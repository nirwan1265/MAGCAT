## INTRODUCTION

### What CATFISH is

**CATFISH** is a gene‑set (pathway) analysis workflow that starts from SNP‑level association results and produces **pathway‑level significance** *plus* a **mechanistic interpretation** of *why* each pathway is significant.

CATFISH uses:

1. **MAGMA** for LD‑aware **SNP → gene** inference (gene-level p-values).
2. **Multiple gene → pathway combination tests** (ACAT, Fisher / wFisher, truncation/TFisher).
3. A **correlation‑robust omnibus test** that aggregates these correlated component tests.
4. A **signal archetype** framework to interpret pathway significance by its gene‑level p‑value rank profile.

### Why multiple tests are needed

Pathways can be significant for qualitatively different reasons:

- one **driver** gene dominates,
- many genes show **coordinated moderate** enrichment,
- or there is a **diffuse polygenic** shift.

No single gene‑set statistic is uniformly most powerful across these regimes. CATFISH therefore treats pathway detection as a **model‑averaging** problem over latent “signal architectures,” rather than a single one‑size‑fits‑all test.

### Bias warning

When calculating over‑representation or enrichment, pathway‑based analysis is subject to multiple biases; **gene size**, **pathway size**, **density of SNP coverage**, and **linkage disequilibrium (LD)** patterns are all factors that must be considered and appropriately addressed (White et al., 2020; PMC6391732), which we have tried to address in our pipeline.

## METHODS

### Notation

Let a pathway (gene set) be denoted by $S$, containing $G = |S|$ genes indexed by $g = 1,\dots,G$.

Let the (adjusted) gene-level p-values be:

$$
\mathbf{p}_S = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_G).
$$

Let the ordered p-values be:

$$
p_{(1)} \le p_{(2)} \le \dots \le p_{(G)}.
$$

---

## 1) Gene-level association statistics (SNP → gene)

For each gene $g$, MAGMA produces a gene‑level association p‑value $p_g$ by aggregating SNP‑level signals within/near the gene while accounting for local LD using a reference panel.

Conceptually:

- SNPs are mapped to genes (gene boundaries with optional windows).
- A multi‑marker gene model accounts for LD among SNPs in the gene region.
- MAGMA outputs gene statistics (e.g., $Z_g$ and $p_g$).

> In CATFISH, these MAGMA gene p-values are treated as the primitive inputs to all pathway tests.

---

## 2) Competitive enrichment framing (pathway vs background)

Pathway interpretation is most stable under **competitive** enrichment logic: a pathway is significant if its member genes are *more associated* than genes outside the pathway (i.e., relative enrichment), rather than simply showing absolute polygenicity.

Practical implications:

- Prefer competitive gene‑set testing frameworks (e.g., MAGMA competitive gene‑set regression) when available.
- When using gene‑p combination tests (ACAT/Fisher/TFisher) as pathway detectors, interpret them as **enrichment summaries** and retain covariate controls / calibrations (below) to mitigate confounding.

---

## 3) Optional gene-level adjustment for gene size and SNP density

Even with LD-aware gene testing, gene‑level signals can exhibit residual dependence on gene size and SNP density. CATFISH optionally performs a post‑hoc adjustment at the gene level.

Let:

- $Z_g$ be the MAGMA gene Z‑statistic,
- $L_g$ be gene length (bp),
- $S_g$ be number of SNPs mapped to the gene (e.g., `NSNPS`).

Fit:

$$
Z_g = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(L_g) + \beta_2 \log(S_g) + \varepsilon_g.
$$

Define adjusted residual Z:

$$
Z^{\mathrm{adj}}_g = Z_g - \widehat{Z}_g,
\quad \widehat{Z}_g = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \log(L_g) + \widehat{\beta}_2 \log(S_g).
$$

Convert to a two‑sided adjusted p-value:

$$
p^{\mathrm{adj}}_g = 2\Phi\left(-|Z^{\mathrm{adj}}_g|\right),
$$

where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF.

---

## 4) Pathway-level test statistics (gene → pathway)

CATFISH computes multiple pathway statistics from $\{p_g\}_{g \in S}$.

### 4.1 ACAT (Aggregated Cauchy Association Test)

Define the Cauchy‑transformed score for each gene:

$$
t_g = \tan\left(\pi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} - p_g\right)\right).
$$

Define non‑negative weights $w_g \ge 0$ with $\sum_{g \in S} w_g = 1$ (default $w_g = 1/G$).

The ACAT statistic is:

$$
T_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S) = \sum_{g \in S} w_g\, t_g
= \sum_{g \in S} w_g \tan\left(\pi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} - p_g\right)\right).
$$

The combined p-value is:

$$
p_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S) = \tfrac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi}\arctan\left(T_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S)\right).
$$

**Key property (interpretation):** ACAT is asymptotically dominated by the smallest p-values, and is therefore sensitive to **sparse driver** architectures.

---

### 4.2 Fisher’s method (coordinated enrichment)

Fisher’s statistic is:

$$
T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S) = -2\sum_{g \in S} \log(p_g).
$$

Under independence,

$$
T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S) \sim \chi^2_{2G},
\quad
p_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S) = 1 - F_{\chi^2_{2G}}\left(T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S)\right),
$$

where $F_{\chi^2_{2G}}(\cdot)$ is the $\chi^2$ CDF with $2G$ degrees of freedom.

**Key property (interpretation):** Fisher is sensitive to **coordinated moderate enrichment** (many moderately small p-values).

---

### 4.3 Weighted Fisher (optional)

A common weighted variant is:

$$
T_{\mathrm{wFisher}}(S) = -2\sum_{g \in S} w_g \log(p_g),
$$

with weights $w_g$ reflecting, for example, gene importance, expression specificity, or QC confidence (must be pre‑specified to avoid circularity).

---

### 4.4 Truncation / TFisher (tail-focused enrichment)

To emphasize only the lower tail (top genes), define a truncation threshold $\tau \in (0,1)$ and consider:

#### (A) Hard truncated Fisher (conceptual)

$$
T_{\mathrm{TF}}(S;\tau) = -2\sum_{g \in S: p_g \le \tau} \log(p_g).
$$

This interpolates between minP‑like behavior (very small $\tau$) and Fisher (large $\tau$).

#### (B) Soft TFisher (recommended)

Soft‑truncation uses a continuous tail‑weighting scheme that downweights large p-values without an abrupt cutoff. In practice, CATFISH/MAGCAT can compute **soft TFisher** using an analytic null CDF (and optionally permutation calibration).

**Key property (interpretation):** truncation/TFisher is powerful for **hybrid driver–support** architectures (a few strong genes + several moderate ones).

---

## 5) Correlation among pathway tests

All pathway statistics above are functions of the **same** gene-level p-values $\{p_g\}$, and are therefore intrinsically correlated:

$$
\left(T_{\mathrm{ACAT}},\,T_{\mathrm{Fisher}},\,T_{\mathrm{TF}}(\tau)\right)
\text{ are dependent}.
$$

Examples of why:

- Fisher and TFisher share overlapping subsets of $\{p_g\}$.
- ACAT and TFisher are both strongly influenced by the extreme left tail (smallest $p_g$).
- LD and shared biology induce correlation among gene-level signals, further increasing dependence.

**Implication:** naïve combination rules assuming independence between component pathway tests would be invalid (often anti‑conservative).

---

## 6) Omnibus pathway testing (correlation-robust model averaging)

Because no single test is uniformly optimal across latent pathway architectures, we compute multiple component p-values:

$$
\mathcal{P}(S) = \left\{ p_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S),\, p_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S),\, p_{\mathrm{TF}}(S;\tau) \right\}.
$$

We then combine them into a single omnibus p-value using ACAT again:

### 6.1 Omnibus ACAT statistic

Let $p_1, p_2, p_3$ denote the three component p-values and $v_j \ge 0$ be weights with $\sum_j v_j = 1$ (default $v_j = 1/3$).

Define:

$$
T_{\mathrm{omni}}(S) = \sum_{j=1}^{3} v_j \tan\left(\pi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} - p_j\right)\right).
$$

Then:

$$
p_{\mathrm{omni}}(S) =
\tfrac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi}\arctan\left(T_{\mathrm{omni}}(S)\right).
$$

### 6.2 Why this is valid under dependence

ACAT is designed to be robust to **arbitrary dependence** among inputs in many practical settings because the Cauchy tail behavior yields stable combined p-values without needing an explicit covariance estimate.

**Interpretation:** omnibus significance indicates that *at least one plausible signal architecture* is supported by the data. It does **not** imply uniform enrichment across all genes.

---

## 7) Optional permutation calibration (when you want empirical p-values)

Permutation can be used to calibrate pathway p-values (especially truncation-based statistics) under complex dependence and finite-sample quirks.

A generic permutation p-value is:

$$
p_{\mathrm{perm}} = \frac{1 + \sum_{b=1}^{B} \mathbf{1}\left(T^{(b)} \ge T^{\mathrm{obs}}\right)}{B + 1}.
$$

**Note:** the minimum achievable permutation p-value is $1/(B+1)$; increasing $B$ increases resolution but should not be interpreted as “making results more significant” unless the observed statistic truly lies in the extreme tail.

---

## 8) Multiple testing correction

Across all pathways, omnibus p-values $\{p_{\mathrm{omni}}(S)\}$ are adjusted using Benjamini–Hochberg FDR:

$$
q_{\mathrm{BH}}(S) = \mathrm{BH}\left(p_{\mathrm{omni}}(S)\right).
$$

Because each pathway yields a **single** omnibus p-value, no additional penalty is required for the number of component tests.

# Pathway signal archetypes (interpretation layer)

CATFISH interprets each significant pathway by classifying the **rank profile** of its gene-level p-values into one of several archetypes and reporting which component test drove significance.

## Archetype I — Sparse Driver Architecture (SDA)

**Signature:** one or a few genes are extremely significant; most genes are null.

$$
p_{(1)} \ll \alpha,
\quad
p_{(k)} \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)\ \ \forall k > K.
$$

**Best detectors:** ACAT, minP-like behavior, hard truncation.  
**Interpretation:** pathway is significant due to **driver gene dominance**, not broad engagement.

---

## Archetype II — Coordinated Moderate Enrichment (CME)

**Signature:** many genes show moderate association; no single extreme driver.

$$
\exists\ \text{non-trivial fraction of } g \text{ with } p_g \in [10^{-3},\,0.05],
\quad
\text{and } p_{(1)} \text{ not overwhelmingly dominant}.
$$

**Best detectors:** Fisher / wFisher / mean‑Z aggregation.  
**Interpretation:** **collective functional engagement**.

---

## Archetype III — Diffuse Polygenic Shift (DPS)

**Signature:** weak but consistent deviation from null; few (if any) cross 0.05.

$$
\mathbb{E}[Z_g] > 0
\quad \text{but} \quad
p_g \not\ll 0.05 \text{ for most } g.
$$

**Best detectors:** regression / distributional‑shift competitive models (e.g., MAGMA competitive).  
**Interpretation:** **global pathway bias** consistent with polygenicity.

---

## Archetype IV — Hybrid Driver–Support (HDS)

**Signature:** a few strong genes + several moderately associated genes.

$$
p_{(1)} \ll 10^{-4},
\quad
p_{(2..K)} \in [10^{-3},\,0.05].
$$

**Best detectors:** truncation/TFisher + Fisher + omnibus.  
**Interpretation:** **hierarchical pathway organization** (drivers + supporting machinery).

---

## Archetype V — Single-Gene Proxy Pathway (SGP)

**Signature:** pathway signal disappears after removing/conditioning on top gene(s).

Operationally:

- recompute pathway p-value after removing $g^\*$ (top gene),
- or perform conditional gene‑set analysis if available.

**Best detectors (but potentially misleading):** minP, uncorrected ACAT.  
**Interpretation:** pathway is a **proxy** for a gene‑level association (annotation reuse / overlap).

---

## Archetype VI — Heterogeneous / Antagonistic (HAA)

**Signature:** heterogeneous submodules, mixed directions, or context dependence; mean-based tests can cancel.

**Best detectors:** stratified/signed models; sub‑pathway or network‑aware analyses.  
**Interpretation:** requires **substructure-aware** modeling; global enrichment may be misleading.

---

## Recommended reporting checklist (per significant pathway)

- **Archetype call:** SDA / CME / DPS / HDS / SGP / HAA  
- **Driver test:** which component (ACAT vs Fisher vs TFisher) primarily drove $p_{\mathrm{omni}}$  
- **Robustness:** persistence after conditioning/removing top gene(s) (flags SGP)  
- **Bias controls:** gene size, SNP density/gene density, pathway size, LD panel choice  
- **Calibration:** analytic vs permutation p-values (and $B$ used if permutation)

## USAGE

# MAGCAT (R package wrapper)

**MAGCAT** is the R interface implementation used to run CATFISH‑style workflows on top of MAGMA, and to compute ACAT/Fisher/TFisher + omnibus pathway statistics.

---

## Installation

### 1) Install MAGMA (external dependency)

Download MAGMA from the official site and make the `magma` executable available on your `PATH`:

- https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma

### 2) Install MAGCAT in R

```r
# install.packages("devtools")  # if needed
devtools::install_github("nirwan1265/MAGCAT")
library(MAGCAT)
```

### 3) Optional: set MAGMA path

```r
MAGCAT::magma_set_path("/full/path/to/magma")
```

---

## Conceptual workflow (end-to-end)

1. **SNP → gene (MAGMA)**
   - Prepare SNP locations (`*.snp.loc`) and gene locations (`*.genes.loc`).
   - Run MAGMA annotation and gene analysis to get gene Z and p.

2. **Gene-level adjustment (optional)**
   - Regress $Z_g$ on `log(gene_length)` and `log(NSNPS)`; derive $p^{adj}_g$.

3. **Gene → pathway tests**
   - Compute pathway p-values from adjusted gene p-values using:
     - ACAT,
     - Fisher,
     - soft TFisher (tail-focused).

4. **Omnibus**
   - Combine pathway p-values using ACAT to produce $p_{\mathrm{omni}}$.

5. **Multiple testing**
   - BH FDR (and optional Storey q-values).

## Quick R example (MAGCAT-style)

> **Note:** function names below follow the style of your MAGCAT wrapper. If your package uses slightly different names/arguments, keep the structure and edit names to match your exported API.

```r

# Top pathways
head(res_omni[order(res_omni$omni_p), ], 10)
```

---

## Suggested output columns (pathway-level)

For each pathway, CATFISH/MAGCAT should report at minimum:

- `pathway_id`, `pathway_name`, `n_genes`
- `acat_p`
- `fisher_p` (and optionally `wfisher_p`)
- `tfisher_p_analytic` (and optionally `tfisher_p_perm`)
- `omni_p`
- `omni_p_BH` (and optional `omni_p_q`)
- `driver_component` (which test drove the omnibus)
- `archetype` (SDA/CME/DPS/HDS/SGP/HAA)
