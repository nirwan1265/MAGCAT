## INTRODUCTION

### What CATFISH is

**CATFISH** (**C**ombining **A**CAT, **T**Fisher (soft), **F**isher, m**I**n-P, and **S**touffer for **H**olistic pathway analysis) is a model-averaged pathway framework that combines ACAT, soft TFisher, Fisher, Stouffer, and minP on top of LD-aware MAGMA gene-level GWAS statistics adjusted for gene length and SNP density. It then uses an omnibus test based on permutation-calibrated minP or ACAT to collapse these multiple pathway tests into a single, correlation-robust enrichment p-value that is sensitive to both sparse and polygenic pathway patterns.

CATFISH uses:

1. **MAGMA** for LD-aware **SNP → gene** inference (gene-level p-values).
2. **Multiple gene → pathway combination tests** (ACAT, Fisher, soft TFisher, Stouffer).
3. A **correlation-robust omnibus test** (permutation-calibrated minP and ACAT-O) that aggregates these correlated component tests into a single pathway-level p-value.

### Why multiple tests are needed

Pathways can be significant for statistically different reasons:

- one driver gene dominates,
- many genes show coordinated moderate enrichment,
- diffuse polygenic shift, and
- hybrids of these patterns.

No single gene-set statistic is uniformly most powerful across these various possibilities. Instead of relying on a single test, CATFISH runs several complementary pathway tests and combines them into one omnibus p-value. We summarize these patterns using a set of **pathway signal archetypes** (sparse driver, coordinated moderate enrichment, diffuse polygenic shift, hybrid driver–support, single-gene proxy), which describe different ways a pathway can appear significant.

# Pathway signal archetypes

We divide the pathway signals into a small set of archetypes that describe different ways a pathway can be enriched as explained above. We then use a combination of statistical tests chosen to be representative to each of these behaviors and a provide a biological example for each archetype.

## Archetype I — Sparse Driver Architecture (SDA)

**Signature:** one or a few genes are extremely significant; most genes look null.

- The top gene p-value `p_(1)` is much smaller than α (e.g. `p_(1) ≈ 1e-6` or smaller).
- The remaining gene p-values in the pathway are approximately uniform on (0, 1).

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**

- **ACAT** (loves a few very small high p’s)
- **minP / Tippett** (minimum p-value)

**Interpretation:**  
The pathway is significant because of **driver gene dominance**, not broad engagement. Biologically, this could be a core “bottleneck” gene whose annotation pulls in a whole pathway.

**Biological example:**  
**Aspartokinase in the aspartate-derived amino acid pathway**

The aspartate-derived amino acid biosynthesis pathway converts aspartate into a family of essential amino acids, including lysine, threonine, methionine, and isoleucine. In bacteria and plants, the first committed step is catalyzed by aspartokinase (AK), which phosphorylates aspartate to aspartyl-phosphate. This step sits at the top of a branched network of downstream reactions that eventually produce the different end-products.

In many organisms, AK is the main flux-controlling bottleneck: its activity largely determines how much carbon and nitrogen flow into the entire aspartate family. AK is tightly regulated by feedback inhibition from lysine, threonine, methionine, or combinations of these products, while most downstream enzymes (transaminases, dehydrogenases, small tailoring steps) are more housekeeping-like and do not exert the same degree of control.

If you GWAS a trait like grain lysine content or total aspartate-family amino acid content, a plausible pattern is:

one or a small number of AK genes / isozymes (for example, a lysine-regulated AK isoform) show very strong association (extremely small gene-level p-values), because changes in AK activity directly modulate flux into all branches;

most other pathway genes have p-values that look null or weak, because common variation there has smaller or more buffered effects.

At the pathway level this yields a Sparse Driver Architecture:

p_(1) (for the top AK gene) is tiny (e.g. 1e-8, 1e-10),

p_(2), p_(3), … are mostly noise-like, scattered over (0,1).

---

## Archetype II — Coordinated Moderate Enrichment (CME)

**Signature:** many genes show moderate association; no single gene is insanely extreme.

- A non-trivial fraction of genes have p in, say, `[1e-3, 0.05]`,
- The top p-value is not massively more extreme than the rest.

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**

- **Fisher’s method** (sum of log p’s)
- Optionally **wFisher / mean-Z** if you ever add weights

**Interpretation:**  
This reflects **collective functional engagement**: the pathway as a whole is involved, even if no single gene is a monster hit.

**Biological example:**  
**Cytokine / immune signaling cascades**

When tissues are injured or infected, inflammatory signaling does not flip through a single master switch. Instead, cytokine cascades (such as IL-6/JAK–STAT or NF-κB signaling) act as multi-step modules that sense danger, transmit the signal through the cell, and reprogram gene expression to mount a response and then turn it back down.

A typical pro-inflammatory module includes:

Cytokines (e.g. IL6, TNF, IL1B) that are secreted as soluble “alarm” signals,

Cell-surface receptors (IL6R, TNFRSF family) that detect these alarms on target cells,

Intracellular kinases and adaptors (JAKs, MAPKs, TRAFs, IKKs) that propagate the signal through phosphorylation cascades,

Transcription factors (STATs, RELA/NF-κB) that enter the nucleus and change the expression of hundreds of target genes,

Plus feedback and regulatory nodes (inhibitors, decoy receptors, suppressors) that damp or reshape the response.

Functionally, the inflammatory tone of a tissue is set by small perturbations at many of these steps: a bit more or less receptor on the surface, slightly altered kinase activity, modest changes in transcription factor binding efficiency, or subtle shifts in the strength of negative feedback. No single gene acts as a strict on/off switch; the phenotype emerges from coordinated nudges across the module.

In an association context (e.g. CRP levels, autoimmune disease risk, or cytokine concentrations), this architecture tends to produce many genes with modest effects rather than one overwhelming driver: gene-level p-values cluster in a “pretty good” range (around 10⁻³–10⁻²) across a dozen or more pathway members, with no single gene showing an extreme p-value like 10⁻¹².

At the pathway level this is a textbook Coordinated Moderate Enrichment (CME) pattern: the entire signaling module is slightly shifted in the same general direction. In CATFISH, this kind of signal is best captured by Fisher’s method, Stouffer/mean-Z, and soft TFisher with a mild truncation, all of which gain power from many moderately associated genes rather than a single spike.



---

## Archetype III — Diffuse Polygenic Shift (DPS)

**Signature:** the pathway’s genes are, on average, slightly more associated than the genome-wide background, but almost none cross a conventional 0.05 threshold.

- Most p-values are > 0.05,
- But the **mean adjusted Z (`Z_adj`) is shifted** away from 0 in one direction.

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**

- **Stouffer / mean-Z on `Z_adj`** (unweighted; permutation-calibrated)
- Optionally **competitive regression models** (e.g. MAGMA competitive) if you include them

**Interpretation:**  
This is a **global pathway bias consistent with polygenicity** – lots of tiny pushes in the same direction, no obvious star gene. It’s the “many gnats, no dragon” scenario.

**Biological example:**  
**Human height as a diffuse polygenic shift**

Human adult height is one of the clearest examples of an extremely polygenic trait. Early GWAS meta-analyses identified hundreds of common variants at roughly 180 loci that each shift height by only a few millimetres, already demonstrating that height is influenced by many genes of small effect rather than a handful of large-effect loci (Lango Allen et al., 2010). Subsequent larger studies in ~250,000 individuals extended this to hundreds of loci and hundreds of genome-wide significant variants (Wood et al., 2014). A later meta-analysis in roughly 700,000 Europeans mapped over 3,000 independent SNPs associated with height, explaining a substantial fraction of common-variant heritability and reinforcing the view that height is governed by many small contributions dispersed across the genome (Yengo et al., 2018). Most recently, “saturated” maps of height genetics suggest that tens of thousands of common variants across the genome contribute measurably to adult height, consistent with an extremely dense, polygenic architecture (Wainschtein et al., 2022).

Biologically, height integrates multiple processes: chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy in the growth plate, extracellular matrix and cartilage organization, growth hormone and IGF-1 signaling, morphogen pathways such as Wnt, Hedgehog, and BMP/TGF-β, and systemic influences including endocrine regulation and nutrition (Wood et al., 2014; Yengo et al., 2018). Across these pathways, there is no single “height gene” in typical populations. Instead, many genes carry one or more common variants with very small effects, so that individual gene-level tests often do not pass stringent significance thresholds in a single study. When one aggregates a biologically coherent pathway—for example, genes involved in growth-plate extracellular matrix, GH/IGF signaling, or chondrocyte differentiation—the distribution of gene-level p-values is subtly but consistently shifted toward smaller values compared with a random set of genes: there are more p-values in, say, the 0.1–0.01 range and fewer near 1.0 than expected under a uniform null.

This pattern is exactly what we mean by a Diffuse Polygenic Shift (DPS) archetype. Almost none of the genes in the pathway individually surpass a conventional per-gene significance threshold after correction, yet the aggregate distribution of p-values (or Z-scores) is clearly enriched for modest effects relative to the genome-wide background, especially in large cohorts. In this regime, spike-oriented tests such as ACAT or minP are not ideal, because there is no single outlier to exploit. Instead, methods that compare the mean or overall distribution of test statistics—such as Fisher’s method, Stouffer/mean-Z, or competitive regression-style gene-set models (e.g. MAGMA competitive)—are more appropriate, because they are designed to detect exactly this kind of low-amplitude but widespread deviation from the null. From a biological standpoint, such DPS-type pathways are still highly relevant: they correspond to core developmental and endocrine programs for height that are modulated not by a single catastrophic lesion but by the cumulative effect of many tiny perturbations spread across the entire module.

## Archetype IV — Hybrid Driver–Support (HDS)

**Signature:** a few very strong genes plus a supporting cast of moderately associated genes.

- The top one or few genes have very small p-values (e.g. < 1e-4),
- Several additional genes have p in `[1e-3, 0.05]`.

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**

- **Soft TFisher** (truncated / tail-focused, but not as extreme as minP)
- **Fisher** (picks up the moderate bulk)
- **Omnibus combo** (ACAT over ACAT/Fisher/TFisher/Stouffer)

**Interpretation:**  
This fits a **hierarchical pathway organization**: a few “driver” genes plus **supporting machinery**. It’s often what you expect for key biosynthetic or signaling pathways.



**Biological example:**
**Hybrid Driver–Support (HDS) – LDL cholesterol / lipoprotein metabolism**

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) regulation is a classic example of a hybrid driver–support architecture. A small number of genes act as major “drivers” with very large effects, while a broader set of pathway members make more modest, supporting contributions.

At the top of the hierarchy are genes such as LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9. Loss-of-function or strongly damaging variants in LDLR or APOB cause familial hypercholesterolemia, characterized by markedly elevated LDL-C and very high risk of premature coronary artery disease (Goldstein and Brown, 2015). Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 similarly raise LDL-C by accelerating LDL receptor degradation, whereas loss-of-function variants lower LDL-C and protect against coronary events (Abifadel et al., 2003; Cohen et al., 2006). These three genes can produce multi-standard-deviation shifts in LDL-C and are clear “driver” nodes in the lipoprotein metabolism network.

Surrounding these drivers is a supporting cast of genes involved in lipoprotein assembly, remodeling, and cholesterol transport. This includes other apolipoproteins (e.g. APOE, APOA1, APOC3), intestinal and hepatobiliary transporters (e.g. ABCG5, ABCG8), and enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis and regulation (e.g. HMGCR, NPC1L1). Common variants in many of these genes show reproducible but smaller effects on LDL-C and cardiovascular risk in large GWAS and sequencing studies—typically modest changes in LDL-C or odds ratios that only become clearly detectable when aggregated across very large cohorts (Teslovich et al., 2010; Do et al., 2013; Ference et al., 2019).

If you turn this biology into gene-level association statistics for an LDL-related trait, the pathway does not look purely “sparse driver” (one screaming gene and nothing else), nor purely “coordinated moderate” (dozens of similar-strength signals). Instead, you tend to see a handful of very small p-values at LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, etc., sitting on top of a broader base of moderately associated genes with p-values in roughly the 10⁻³–10⁻² range. That is exactly the Hybrid Driver–Support (HDS) pattern: a pathway whose statistical enrichment reflects a few dominant levers plus a genuine, but softer, contribution from the wider metabolic machinery. In CATFISH terms, this is where soft TFisher (which emphasizes the lower tail but still counts the moderate p-values), together with Fisher and the omnibus combination, is particularly well matched.


---

## Archetype V — Single-Gene Proxy Pathway (SGP)

**Signature:** the entire pathway signal is explained by one gene; remove that gene and the pathway is no longer significant.

Operationally you can flag it by:

- Removing the top gene `g*` from the pathway and recomputing the pathway p-value,
- Marking pathways where the p-value becomes non-significant after that removal.

**Best detectors / diagnostics in CATFISH:**

- **minP / Tippett** (will happily call these significant),
- **ACAT** (also loves a single extreme gene),
- **SGP check:** “recompute without top gene” as a *diagnostic*, not as another omnibus test.

**Interpretation:**  
The pathway is essentially a **proxy for a single gene-level association** (often due to dense annotation or overlapping pathway definitions). Biologically, the pathway may still be relevant, but you should interpret it as “this gene is driving everything.”


**Biological example:**  
**PAH in phenylalanine metabolism**
Phenylalanine metabolism is dominated by a single bottleneck enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. In humans, loss or severe reduction of PAH activity causes hyperphenylalaninemia and classic phenylketonuria (PKU) where phenylalanine accumulates to toxic levels, while downstream products are depleted. Most cases of elevated phenylalanine (HPA) are due to PAH deficiency, whereas only a minority are caused by defects in cofactor (BH₄) metabolism. Here, one gene (PAH) is the critical flux-controlling step;

Other genes in the “phenylalanine metabolism” pathway (transporters, minor side-enzymes, cofactor recycling, etc.) generally have much weaker or rarer effects at the population level.

### Bias warning

When calculating over‑representation or enrichment, pathway‑based analysis is subject to multiple biases; **gene size**, **pathway size**, **density of SNP coverage**, and **linkage disequilibrium (LD)** patterns are all factors that must be considered and appropriately addressed (White et al., 2020; PMC6391732), which we have tried to address in our pipeline.  
Link: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6391732/

## METHODS

### Notation

Let a pathway (gene set) be denoted by $S$, containing $G = |S|$ genes indexed by $g = 1,\dots,G$.

Let the (adjusted) gene-level p-values be:

$$
\mathbf{p}_S = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_G).
$$

Let the ordered p-values be:

$$
p_{(1)} \le p_{(2)} \le \dots \le p_{(G)}.
$$

---

## 1) Gene-level association statistics (SNP → gene)

For each gene $g$, MAGMA produces a gene‑level association p‑value $p_g$ by aggregating SNP‑level signals within/near the gene while accounting for local LD using a reference panel.

Conceptually:

- SNPs are mapped to genes (gene boundaries with optional windows).
- A multi‑marker gene model accounts for LD among SNPs in the gene region.
- MAGMA outputs gene statistics (e.g., $Z_g$ and $p_g$).

> In CATFISH, these MAGMA gene p-values are treated as the primitive inputs to all pathway tests.

---

## 2) Competitive enrichment framing (pathway vs background)

Pathway interpretation is most stable under **competitive** enrichment logic: a pathway is significant if its member genes are *more associated* than genes outside the pathway (i.e., relative enrichment), rather than simply showing absolute polygenicity.

Practical implications:

- Prefer competitive gene‑set testing frameworks (e.g., MAGMA competitive gene‑set regression) when available.
- When using gene‑p combination tests (ACAT/Fisher/TFisher) as pathway detectors, interpret them as **enrichment summaries** and retain covariate controls / calibrations (below) to mitigate confounding.

---

## 3) Optional gene-level adjustment for gene size and SNP density

Even with LD-aware gene testing, gene‑level signals can exhibit residual dependence on gene size and SNP density. CATFISH optionally performs a post‑hoc adjustment at the gene level.

Let:

- $Z_g$ be the MAGMA gene Z‑statistic,
- $L_g$ be gene length (bp),
- $S_g$ be number of SNPs mapped to the gene (e.g., `NSNPS`).

Fit:

$$
Z_g = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(L_g) + \beta_2 \log(S_g) + \varepsilon_g.
$$

Define adjusted residual Z:

$$
Z^{\mathrm{adj}}_g = Z_g - \widehat{Z}_g,
\quad \widehat{Z}_g = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \log(L_g) + \widehat{\beta}_2 \log(S_g).
$$

Convert to a two‑sided adjusted p-value:

$$
p^{\mathrm{adj}}_g = 2\Phi\left(-|Z^{\mathrm{adj}}_g|\right),
$$

where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF.

---

## 4) Pathway-level test statistics (gene → pathway)

CATFISH computes multiple pathway statistics from $\{p_g\}_{g \in S}$.

### 4.1 ACAT (Aggregated Cauchy Association Test)

Define the Cauchy‑transformed score for each gene:

$$
t_g = \tan\left(\pi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} - p_g\right)\right).
$$

Define non‑negative weights $w_g \ge 0$ with $\sum_{g \in S} w_g = 1$ (default $w_g = 1/G$).

The ACAT statistic is:

$$
T_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S) = \sum_{g \in S} w_g\, t_g
= \sum_{g \in S} w_g \tan\left(\pi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} - p_g\right)\right).
$$

The combined p-value is:

$$
p_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S) = \tfrac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi}\arctan\left(T_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S)\right).
$$

**Key property (interpretation):** ACAT is asymptotically dominated by the smallest p-values, and is therefore sensitive to **sparse driver** architectures.

---

### 4.2 Fisher’s method (coordinated enrichment)

Fisher’s statistic is:

$$
T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S) = -2\sum_{g \in S} \log(p_g).
$$

Under independence,

$$
T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S) \sim \chi^2_{2G},
\quad
p_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S) = 1 - F_{\chi^2_{2G}}\left(T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S)\right),
$$

where $F_{\chi^2_{2G}}(\cdot)$ is the $\chi^2$ CDF with $2G$ degrees of freedom.

**Key property (interpretation):** Fisher is sensitive to **coordinated moderate enrichment** (many moderately small p-values).

---

### 4.3 Weighted Fisher (optional)

A common weighted variant is:

$$
T_{\mathrm{wFisher}}(S) = -2\sum_{g \in S} w_g \log(p_g),
$$

with weights $w_g$ reflecting, for example, gene importance, expression specificity, or QC confidence (must be pre‑specified to avoid circularity).

---

### 4.4 Truncation / TFisher (tail-focused enrichment)

To emphasize only the lower tail (top genes), define a truncation threshold $\tau \in (0,1)$ and consider:

#### (A) Hard truncated Fisher (conceptual)

$$
T_{\mathrm{TF}}(S;\tau) = -2\sum_{g \in S: p_g \le \tau} \log(p_g).
$$

This interpolates between minP‑like behavior (very small $\tau$) and Fisher (large $\tau$).

#### (B) Soft TFisher (recommended)

Soft‑truncation uses a continuous tail‑weighting scheme that downweights large p-values without an abrupt cutoff. In practice, CATFISH/MAGCAT can compute **soft TFisher** using an analytic null CDF (and optionally permutation calibration).

**Key property (interpretation):** truncation/TFisher is powerful for **hybrid driver–support** architectures (a few strong genes + several moderate ones).

---

### 4.5 Stouffer’s method (mean-Z; diffuse polygenic shift)

Stouffer aggregates gene-level **Z** statistics (e.g., `Z_adj`) rather than p-values. For a pathway with genes `g = 1..G`, define:

- **Unweighted Stouffer:**
  - `Z_stouffer = (1/sqrt(G)) * sum_g Z_g`
  - Convert to p-value: `p_stouffer = 2 * Φ( -|Z_stouffer| )`

- **Weighted Stouffer (optional):**
  - Choose weights `w_g >= 0`
  - `Z_stouffer = (sum_g w_g * Z_g) / sqrt( sum_g w_g^2 )`
  - `p_stouffer = 2 * Φ( -|Z_stouffer| )`

Notes:
- Best for **Diffuse Polygenic Shift (DPS)** where the **average Z** is shifted but few genes pass 0.05.
- If you calibrate by permutation, compute `Z_stouffer` on permuted gene labels and use an empirical p-value.

---

### 4.6 minP / Tippett (single-gene proxy diagnostic)

Define the pathway’s minimum gene p-value:

- `p_min = min_g p_g`

Under independence, Tippett’s combined p-value is:

- `p_tippett = 1 - (1 - p_min)^G`

But because gene p-values are correlated (LD, shared biology), CATFISH typically treats **minP as a diagnostic** and/or calibrates it by permutation:

- `p_min_perm = (1 + #{b: p_min^(b) <= p_min_obs}) / (B + 1)`

Notes:
- Highly sensitive to **single extreme genes**, so it flags **Sparse Driver (SDA)** and especially **Single-Gene Proxy (SGP)** pathways.
- Use “remove top gene and recompute” as the practical SGP check.

---

## 5) Correlation among pathway tests

All pathway statistics above are functions of the **same** gene-level p-values $\{p_g\}$, and are therefore intrinsically correlated:

$$
\left(T_{\mathrm{ACAT}},\,T_{\mathrm{Fisher}},\,T_{\mathrm{TF}}(\tau)\right)
\text{ are dependent}.
$$

Examples of why:

- Fisher and TFisher share overlapping subsets of $\{p_g\}$.
- ACAT and TFisher are both strongly influenced by the extreme left tail (smallest $p_g$).
- LD and shared biology induce correlation among gene-level signals, further increasing dependence.

**Implication:** naïve combination rules assuming independence between component pathway tests would be invalid (often anti‑conservative).

---

## 6) Omnibus pathway testing (correlation-robust model averaging)

Because no single test is uniformly optimal across latent pathway architectures, for each pathway `S` we compute a small panel of component p-values:

- `p_ACAT(S)`       – ACAT on gene-level p-values
- `p_Fisher(S)`     – Fisher’s sum-of-logs combination
- `p_TF(S; tau)`    – soft truncated Fisher (TFisher) at threshold `tau`
- `p_Stouffer(S)`   – (optionally weighted) Stouffer / mean-Z combination
- `p_minP(S)`       – within-pathway minP (Tippett) across genes

We then summarize these into *two* omnibus statistics:
(i) an analytic **ACAT-O** combination across methods, and  
(ii) a permutation-calibrated **minimum-p (minP)** across methods.

---

### 6.1 Omnibus ACAT (ACAT-O across methods)

Let `p1, p2, p3, p4, p5` denote the five component p-values for pathway `S`, and let weights `v_j >= 0` satisfy `sum_j v_j = 1` (default `v_j = 1/5`).

Define the ACAT-O Cauchy statistic:

- `T_omni_ACAT(S) = sum_{j=1..5} v_j * tan( pi * (0.5 - p_j) )`

Under the global null, `T_omni_ACAT(S)` is approximately standard Cauchy, giving the analytic omnibus p-value:

- `p_omni_ACAT(S) = 0.5 - (1/pi) * atan( T_omni_ACAT(S) )`

This ACAT-O layer is most sensitive when **at least one** component test (e.g., ACAT for sparse drivers, Fisher / Stouffer for coordinated enrichment, TFisher for hybrid patterns, or minP for hard single-gene hits) is strongly significant, even if the others are not.

---

### 6.2 Omnibus minP across methods with permutation

To obtain a complementary, more conservative summary that explicitly accounts for correlation between component tests, we also compute a minimum-p omnibus statistic across methods:

- `T_omni_min(S) = min_{j in {1,2,3,4,5}} p_j`

equivalently:

- `T_omni_min(S) = min( p_ACAT(S), p_Fisher(S), p_TF(S; tau), p_Stouffer(S), p_minP(S) )`

Because the `p_j` are correlated (all are computed from the same set of gene-level p-values), we calibrate `T_omni_min(S)` by permutation.

For each of `B` permutations:

- randomize gene labels across pathways (preserving the empirical distribution of gene-level p-values),
- recompute all five component tests for each pathway,
- record, for permutation `b = 1..B`:

  - `T_omni_min^(b)(S) = min_j p_j^(b)(S)`

The permutation-based omnibus p-value is:

- `p_omni_min_hat(S) = (1 + #{ b : T_omni_min^(b)(S) <= T_omni_min(S) }) / (B + 1)`

We use `p_omni_min_hat(S)` as the **primary omnibus p-value** in the main analyses because it:

1. protects nominal type-I error under *arbitrary* dependence between component tests, and  
2. explicitly targets the “best” component test for each pathway while accounting for the fact that the best test is chosen post hoc (via the min across methods).

The analytic ACAT-O p-value `p_omni_ACAT(S)` is reported alongside as a **higher-power, model-based sensitivity analysis**, highlighting pathways that are consistently strong across methods or dominated by a single very informative test.


---

## 7) Optional permutation calibration (when you want empirical p-values)

Permutation can be used to calibrate pathway p-values (especially truncation-based statistics) under complex dependence and finite-sample quirks.

A generic permutation p-value is:

$$
p_{\mathrm{perm}} = \frac{1 + \sum_{b=1}^{B} \mathbf{1}\left(T^{(b)} \ge T^{\mathrm{obs}}\right)}{B + 1}.
$$

**Note:** the minimum achievable permutation p-value is $1/(B+1)$; increasing $B$ increases resolution but should not be interpreted as “making results more significant” unless the observed statistic truly lies in the extreme tail.

---

## 8) Multiple testing correction

Across all pathways, omnibus p-values $\{p_{\mathrm{omni}}(S)\}$ are adjusted using Benjamini–Hochberg FDR:

$$
q_{\mathrm{BH}}(S) = \mathrm{BH}\left(p_{\mathrm{omni}}(S)\right).
$$

Because each pathway yields a **single** omnibus p-value, no additional penalty is required for the number of component tests.

## Quick R example (MAGCAT-style)

> **Note:** This is the exact end-to-end pipeline used (MAGMA → gene adjustment → pathway tests → omnibus). Paths, filenames, and column mappings should be edited to match your local files.

```r
############################################################
## MAGCAT PIPELINE: MAGMA → SIZE-ADJUSTED GENE P → PATHWAYS
## (with brief explanation of the key parameters)
############################################################

## MAGCAT gives you:
##  - R wrappers around the MAGMA binary (magma_annotate, magma_gene)
##  - Parallel chromosome-wise runs (chroms, n_threads)
##  - Plant-ready GFF3 → gene loc helpers
##  - Automatic gene-size/#SNP adjustment
##  - A suite of pathway tests + an omnibus layer
##
## Below is the end-to-end flow, with parameter explanations in comments.
############################################################


############################################################
## 1. Build MAGMA gene location file from GFF3
############################################################

gff_path     <- "/Users/.../Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0_Zm00001eb.1.gff3"
gene_loc_out <- "/Users/.../maize.genes.loc"

gff3_to_geneloc(
  gff        = gff_path,
  out        = "inst/extdata/maize.genes.loc",
  chr_prefix = "chr"  # strips "chr" prefix so MAGMA’s CHR matches PLINK CHR
)

## What this does / why:
## - Parses the GFF3, extracts gene features, and writes a MAGMA-ready
##   gene location file (GENE, CHR, START, STOP, STRAND…).
## - When you later call species = "maize" in MAGCAT, it automatically
##   uses inst/extdata/maize.genes.loc and you don’t have to think
##   about coordinates again.


############################################################
## 2. SNP → gene annotation with MAGMA (magma_annotate wrapper)
############################################################

stats_file1 <- "/Users/.../nitrogen_0-5cm_maize_LMM.txt"

magma_annotate(
  stats_file     = stats_file1,
  rename_columns = c(
    CHR    = "chr",    # your column "chr" → MAGMA expects "CHR"
    SNP    = "rs",     # your column "rs"  → "SNP"
    POS    = "ps",     # your column "ps"  → "POS"
    PVALUE = "p_wald"  # your p-value column → "PVALUE"
  ),
  species    = "maize",        # uses built-in maize.genes.loc from step 1
  out_prefix = "N_maize_MLM",  # prefix for MAGMA output files
  out_dir    = "annot",        # directory to write MAGMA .genes.annot
  window     = c(25, 25)       # +/- 25 kb around each gene for SNP mapping
)

## Under the hood:
## - MAGCAT builds the MAGMA command line and calls the MAGMA binary for you.
## - You just supply stats_file and column rename map; no manual shell scripting.


############################################################
## 3. Gene-level MAGMA (multi = snp-wise) with R wrapper
############################################################

bfile      <- "/Users/.../all_maize2"   # PLINK basename: .bed/.bim/.fam
stats_file2 <- "/Users/.../raw_GWAS_MLM_3PC_N.txt"

## 3A. Chromosome-wise run using NMISS (per-SNP sample size)
magma_gene(
  bfile      = bfile,
  gene_annot = "annot/N_maize_MLM.genes.annot",
  stats_file = stats_file2,
  n_total    = 3539,             # optional global N if NOBS/NMISS absent
  rename_columns = c(
    CHR    = "Chr",
    SNP    = "SNP",
    POS    = "Pos",
    PVALUE = "P.value",
    NMISS  = "n_miss"            # MAGMA interprets this as per-SNP sample size
  ),
  out_prefix = "N_maize_MLM",
  out_dir    = "magma_genes_by_chr",
  gene_model = c("multi=snp-wise"),  # multi-parameter SNP-wise model
  chroms     = 1:10,                 # run MAGMA separately for chr 1–10
  n_threads  = 10                    # run up to 10 MAGMA jobs in parallel
)

## 3B. Chromosome-wise run using NOBS (per-SNP N)
magma_gene(
  bfile      = bfile,
  gene_annot = "annot/N_maize_MLM.genes.annot",
  stats_file = stats_file2,
  rename_columns = c(
    CHR    = "Chr",
    SNP    = "SNP",
    POS    = "Pos",
    PVALUE = "P.value",
    NOBS   = "nobs"             # per-SNP N; preferred over n_total
  ),
  out_prefix = "N_maize_MLM",
  out_dir    = "magma_multi_snp_wise_genes_by_chr_N_maize",
  gene_model = c("multi=snp-wise"),
  chroms     = 1:10,
  n_threads  = 10
)

## Selling point:
## - magma_gene is a high-level R wrapper around the MAGMA binary:
##   * Handles all flags, temp files, and error checking.
##   * Accepts chroms + n_threads to run multiple chromosomes in parallel.
##   * Only requires a minimal rename_columns spec instead of reformatting
##     your GWAS files by hand.


############################################################
## 4. Combine per-chromosome MAGMA gene outputs
############################################################

files <- sprintf(
  "/Users/.../magma_multi_snp_wise_genes_by_chr_N_maize/N_maize_MLM_chr%d.multi_snp_wise.genes.out",
  1:10
)

gene_list <- lapply(files, function(f) {
  if (!file.exists(f)) stop("File not found: ", f)
  utils::read.table(f, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = FALSE)
})

genes_all_raw <- do.call(rbind, gene_list)

# Ensure the gene p column is named "P"
colnames(genes_all_raw)[9] <- "P"

# For genes appearing on multiple chromosomes or windows, keep smallest P
o         <- order(genes_all_raw$GENE, genes_all_raw$P)
genes_all <- genes_all_raw[o, ]
genes_all <- genes_all[!duplicated(genes_all$GENE), ]

# Optionally sort by CHR and START
if (all(c("CHR", "START") %in% names(genes_all))) {
  genes_all <- genes_all[order(genes_all$CHR, genes_all$START), ]
}

write.table(
  genes_all,
  file      = "/Users/.../magma_N_maize.txt",
  sep       = "\t",
  quote     = FALSE,
  row.names = FALSE
)

## Why:
## - This consolidates 10 per-chromosome MAGMA outputs into a single
##   gene-level table with one row per gene, ready for downstream
##   adjustment and pathway analysis.


############################################################
## 5. Gene length extraction + bias adjustment
############################################################

## 5A. Extract gene lengths from GFF3
gff3_path <- system.file(
  "extdata", "GFF3",
  "Zea_mays.Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0.62.chr.gff3",
  package = "MAGCAT"
)

maize_gene_len <- get_gene_lengths(
  gff3_file  = gff3_path,
  output     = TRUE,
  output_dir = "inst/extdata",
  file_name  = "Zea_mays_gene_lengths.tsv"
)

## Output includes:
##   gene_id, chr, start, end, length
## and can be reused across traits.

## 5B. Adjust gene-level Z/P for gene length & #SNPs

genes_all <- read.table(
  "/Users/.../magma_N_maize.txt",
  header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

adj_out <- magcat_adjust_gene_p(
  gene_results = genes_all,
  gene_lengths = maize_gene_len,
  gene_col     = "GENE",
  p_col        = "P",
  z_col        = "ZSTAT",    # raw MAGMA Z
  len_gene_col = "gene_id",
  len_col      = "length"
  # nsnp_col   = "NSNPS"     # optional: adjusts for #SNPs per gene as well
)

genes_adj <- adj_out$genes    # includes Z_raw, Z_adj, P_adj, log_gene_length, log_nsnp
lm_fit    <- adj_out$fit      # lm(Z_raw ~ log_gene_length + log_nsnp)

write.csv(genes_adj, "genes_adj.csv", row.names = FALSE)

## Why:
## - MAGMA gene p-values are known to correlate weakly with gene size
##   and SNP density. magcat_adjust_gene_p:
##   * Fits a linear model: Z_raw ~ log(gene length) + log(#SNPs).
##   * Uses residuals (Z_adj) as “size/SNP-adjusted” Z-scores.
##   * Converts Z_adj back to P_adj = 2*pnorm(-|Z_adj|).
## - You then use P_adj in gene→pathway tests, reducing bias toward big genes.


############################################################
## 6. Load pathway definitions from PMN/CornCyc
############################################################

maize_pw <- magcat_load_pathways(
  species  = "maize",
  gene_col = "Gene-name"  # column in the PMN gene-set file that matches MAGMA gene IDs
)

## Features:
## - MAGCAT ships plant pathway collections (CornCyc, AraCyc, etc.)
## - You can also pass a custom list/data.frame of pathways if you want.


############################################################
## 7. Pathway-level tests (gene → pathway)
############################################################

## All tests use gene_results + species/pathways to:
##  - find genes per pathway,
##  - take their p-values (raw P or adjusted P_adj),
##  - compute a pathway-level p per method.

### 7A. ACAT per pathway

pw_res_acat_adj <- magcat_acat_pathways(
  gene_results = genes_adj,     # use size/SNP-adjusted P_adj
  species      = "maize",
  gene_col     = "GENE",
  p_col        = "P_adj",
  B            = 0L,            # B>0 → permutation-calibrated ACAT
  seed         = NULL,
  output       = TRUE,
  out_dir      = "acat_results"
)

### 7B. ordmeta (rank-based, minimum marginal p over gene rank)

ord_res <- magcat_ordmeta_pathways(
  gene_results = genes_adj,
  species      = "maize",
  gene_col     = "GENE",
  p_col        = "P_adj",
  effect_col   = "ZSTAT",   # needs signed effects for up/down
  is_onetail   = FALSE
)

### 7C. Weighted Fisher (wFisher) pathways

wf_res_raw <- magcat_wfisher_pathways(
  gene_results = genes_all,   # raw P
  species      = "maize",

  p_col        = "P",
  effect_col   = "ZSTAT",
  weight_col   = "NSNPS",     # weight genes by #SNPs
  is_onetail   = FALSE
)

wf_res_adj <- magcat_wfisher_pathways(
  gene_results = genes_adj,   # adjusted P
  species      = "maize",
  gene_col     = "GENE",
  p_col        = "P_adj",
  effect_col   = "ZSTAT",
  is_onetail   = FALSE        # two-sided test with sign from ZSTAT
)

### 7D. Truncated Fisher / TFisher

tf_res_adj <- magcat_tfisher_pathways(
  gene_results     = genes_adj,
  species          = "maize",
  gene_col         = "GENE",
  p_col            = "P_adj",
  ptrunc           = 0.05,     # only genes with p <= 0.05 contribute
  B_perm           = 10000L,   # gene-set permutations for empirical p
  seed             = 123,
  analytic_logical = TRUE,     # also report chi-square approx p
  output           = TRUE,
  out_dir          = "magcat_tfisher"
)

### 7E. Soft TFisher (smooth truncation)

soft_tf_res_adj <- magcat_soft_tfisher_pathways(
  gene_results     = genes_adj,
  species          = "maize",
  gene_col         = "GENE",
  p_col            = "P_adj",
  tau1             = 0.05,     # soft truncation threshold
  B_perm           = 10000L,
  seed             = 123,
  analytic_logical = TRUE,
  output           = TRUE,
  out_dir          = "magcat_tfisher_soft"
)

### 7F. Stouffer (sum of Z across genes)

stouf_res <- magcat_stouffer_pathways(
  gene_results = genes_adj,
  species      = "maize",
  gene_col     = "GENE",
  p_col        = "P_adj",
  weight_col   = NULL,    # equal weights for all genes
  B_perm       = 100L,    # permutations for empirical Stouffer p
  seed         = 123,
  output       = TRUE,
  out_dir      = "magcat_stouffer"
)

### 7G. Gene-level minP per pathway

minp_res <- magcat_minp_pathways(
  gene_results = genes_adj,
  species      = "maize",
  gene_col     = "GENE",
  p_col        = "P_adj",
  B_perm       = 0L,      # analytic only (can turn on permutations)
  min_p        = 1e-15,
  do_fix       = TRUE,
  output       = TRUE,
  out_dir      = "magcat_minp_maize"
)


############################################################
## 8. Omnibus over methods (ACAT-O or method-level minP)
############################################################

omni_minp <- omni_pathways(
  gene_results      = genes_adj,
  species           = "maize",
  gene_col          = "GENE",
  p_col             = "P_adj",
  effect_col        = "Z_adj",     # use adjusted Z for direction
  #weight_col       = "NSNPS",    # optional, if you want wFisher to be weighted
  is_onetail        = FALSE,
  ptrunc            = 0.05,        # passed to internal TFisher component
  min_p             = 1e-15,       # floor for tiny p's (needed for ACAT stability)
  do_fix            = TRUE,
  omnibus           = "minP",      # "ACAT" = ACAT-O across methods, "minP" = minP over methods
  B_perm            = 10000L,      # permutations at the *omnibus* level
  seed              = 123,
  remove_singletons = TRUE,        # drop pathways with n_genes < 2
  output            = TRUE,
  out_dir           = "magcat_omni_full"
)

## In a single call omni_pathways gives you:
##   - acat_p       : ACAT over gene p’s per pathway
##   - wfisher_p    : wFisher per pathway
##   - tpm_p        : truncated Fisher per pathway
##   - stouffer_p   : Stouffer per pathway
##   - minp_gene_p  : gene-level minP per pathway
##   - omni_p       : combination of these methods (ACAT-O or method-level minP)
##   - omni_perm_p  : permutation-calibrated omnibus p
##   - BH FDR and q-values for omni_p and each component
##
## Selling point:
## - Users don’t have to orchestrate multiple scripts or re-run GWAS.
##   They:
##      (1) point MAGCAT to a GFF3 + PLINK + GWAS file,
##      (2) call magma_annotate + magma_gene once,
##      (3) call a single high-level pathway function (ACAT, TFisher, Stouffer,
##          minP, or omni_pathways),
##   and get a full panel of pathway p-values (plus permutation-calibrated
##   omnibus) with plant-aware defaults and parallel MAGMA integration.
