## INTRODUCTION

### What CATFISH is

**CATFISH** (<ins>**C**</ins>ombining <ins>**A**</ins>CAT, <ins>**T**</ins>Fisher (soft), <ins>**F**</ins>isher, m<ins>**I**</ins>n-P, and <ins>**S**</ins>touffer for <ins>**H**</ins>olistic pathway analysis) is a multi-test pathway framework built on LD-aware MAGMA gene-level GWAS statistics adjusted for gene length and SNP density that combines ACAT, soft TFisher, Fisher, Stouffer and minP. It then uses an omnibus test based on permutation-calibrated minP or ACAT to collapse these multiple pathway tests into a single, correlation-robust enrichment p-value that is sensitive to both sparse and polygenic pathway patterns. In short, CATFISH casts a wide net across complementary tests and reels in a single pathway p-value.

CATFISH uses:

1. **MAGMA** for LD-aware **SNP → gene** inference (gene-level p-values).
2. **Multiple gene → pathway combination tests** (ACAT, Fisher, soft TFisher, Stouffer, minP).
3. A **correlation-robust LD-aware omnibus test** (permutation-calibrated minP and ACAT-O) that aggregates these tests into a single pathway-level p-value.

### Why multiple tests are needed

Pathways can be significant for statistically different reasons:

- one driver gene dominates,
- many genes show coordinated moderate enrichment,
- diffuse polygenic shift, and
- hybrids of these patterns.

No single gene-set statistic is uniformly most powerful across these various possibilities. Instead of relying on a single test, CATFISH runs several complementary pathway tests and combines them into one omnibus p-value. We summarize these patterns using a set of **pathway signal archetypes** (sparse driver, coordinated moderate enrichment, diffuse polygenic shift, hybrid driver–support, single-gene proxy), which describe different ways a pathway can appear significant.

# Pathway signal archetypes

We divide the pathway signals into a set of archetypes that describe different ways a pathway can be important in a biological sense explained in detail below. We then use a combination of statistical tests chosen to be representative to each of these behaviors and a provide a biological example for each archetype.

## Archetype I — Sparse Driver Architecture (SDA)

**Signature:** A small number of genes are extremely significant; most genes look null.

**Gene-level p-value pattern:**

- There exists a small $K \ll G$ such that the top $K$ gene p-values are extremely small, $p_{(1)}, \dots, p_{(K)} \ll \alpha$ (e.g. $p_{(1)} \sim 10^{-7}$ or smaller),
- The remaining genes are approximately null, $p_{(K+1)}, \dots, p_{(G)} \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$.
- This produces a sharp “elbow” in the ranked p-values (a few tiny hits followed by a long flat tail).

**Interpretation:**  
An SDA pathway is significant because **a small set of driver genes dominates the signal**, rather than broad involvement of most pathway members. This can occur when the trait-relevant biology passes through a **bottleneck** (committed step, rate-limiting enzyme, key regulator, or essential transporter) so that genetic variation concentrates its effect at a few control points. In contrast, pathway annotations typically include many additional enzymes, modifiers, and general “support” genes that may be necessary for pathway operation but do not carry strong association for the trait. Under SDA, association is therefore concentrated in the top $K$ genes, yielding very small ordered p-values $p\_(1), …, p_(K)$ followed by a long tail $p_(K+1), …, p_(G)$ that is close to uniform.

**Biological example:**  
**Aspartokinase in the aspartate-derived amino acid pathway**

The aspartate-derived amino-acid biosynthesis pathway converts **aspartate** into essential amino acids, such as **lysine**, **threonine**, **methionine**, and **isoleucine**. In plants and bacteria, the first step is catalyzed by **aspartokinase (AK)**, which phosphorylates aspartate to **aspartyl-phosphate** that feeds multiple branched network to produces several end-products. Due to its position at the starting point of the pathway, AK acts as a **flux-controlling bottleneck**. Variations in AK activity alter carbon and nitrogen flow through the whole network. Downstream enzymes, including tailoring steps, dehydrogenases, and transaminases, typically exhibit dispersed or buffered roles. Thus, the gene-level pattern aligns with SDA. A single AK gene or a few genes downstream exhibit very low $p$ values (e.g. $10^{-8}\text{-}10^{-10}$), while the majority are dispersed across the interval $(0,1)$.

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**
- **ACAT** — sensitive to a few extremely small p-values (RECOMMENDED).  
- **minP / Tippett** — targets the minimum p-value; optimal when one gene dominates.


---

## Archetype II — Coordinated Moderate Enrichment (CME)

**Signature:** many genes show moderate association; no single gene is extremely low.

**Gene-level p-value pattern:**
- A non-trivial fraction of genes have moderately small p-values, e.g.
  $$p_i \in [10^{-3},\,0.05]\quad\text{for many } i.$$
- The top signal is not orders-of-magnitude beyond the rest (no single-gene spike), e.g.
  $$p_{(1)} \not\ll p_{(k)}\quad\text{for small }k\ (\text{e.g., }k=5,10,20).$$
- The ranked p-values show a **broad shoulder** (many good genes) but not a sharp elbow.

**Interpretation:**  
CME signifies **collective functional engagement**. The pathway behaves like a coordinated module wherein numerous components exert small-to-moderate effects. This is expected when phenotypes emerge from distributed regulation, redundancy, and buffering/feedback as dramatic single-gene effects are rare. Statistically, enrichment arises from numerous mildly informative genes rather than single driver.

**Biological example:**  
**Cytokine / immune signaling cascades**

In numerous immunological pathways, the output is regulated not by a singular "master gene," but through **distributed modulation across various tiers** of a signaling circuit. A clear example is **TNFα / IL-1β → NF-κB**, where the engagement of upstream receptors ultimately activates **IKK complexes**, which phosphorylate **IκB inhibitors**, facilitating the nuclear translocation of NF-κB family members. Notably, the **temporal dynamics** of NF-κB activation (rapid/transient versus slower/sustained) are significantly influenced by the **stimulus class** and receptor context  (Zhao et al., 2018).The significance of these dynamics lies in the variability of transcriptional outputs influenced by stimulus, NF-κB family composition, and cell type. Core feedback and marker targets encompass genes such as **NFKBIA (IκBα)** and **TNFAIP3 (A20)**, underscoring the notion that pathway behavior is governed by numerous regulatory nodes rather than a singular switch (Zhao et al., 2018).

This “many-knobs” architecture is also apparent one layer upstream in **TNFRSF signaling**. TNFRSF receptors bind trimeric TNFSF ligands, however, increasing evidence suggests that **a single trimeric ligand–receptor complex fails** to elicit complete signaling output. Rather, for certain TNFRSF pathways (notably the **classical NF-κB pathway**), successful activation may necessitate **secondary interactions or clustering of multiple trimeric receptor complexes** (Medler et al., 2019). Mechanistically, this indicates that pathway output relies on the coordinated effects of receptor assembly/avidity, adaptor recruitment, kinase activation thresholds, and the strength of negative feedback—precisely the type of system where typical genetic variation is anticipated to produce **numerous modest perturbations** rather than a singularly significant driver.

In CATFISH terminology, this yields a CME pattern: within a cytokine/immune circuit, gene-level p-values exhibit a surplus of moderate signals (e.g., numerous genes around 10⁻³–10⁻²) without a singular extreme outlier:
$$ (p_{(1)}, p_{(2)}, \ldots) \text{ comprises numerous values approximately in the range of } 10^{-3} \text{--}10^{-2} \text{ without an extreme such as } 10^{-12}.Consequently, CME pathways are optimally represented by **evidence-accumulating tests** (e.g., Fisher, Stouffer/mean-Z, and mild-truncation/soft-TFisher), whose efficacy is enhanced when *numerous* route members exhibit moderate associations, rather than depending on a singular peak.

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**
- **Fisher’s method** (aggregates evidence across many moderately small p-values) (RECOMMENDED).
- **Stouffer / mean-Z** (gains power when many genes shift together).
- Optionally **wFisher / weighted Z** if you later add biologically informed weights.

## Archetype III — Diffuse Polygenic Shift (DPS)

**Signature:** the pathway’s genes are, on average, slightly more associated than the genome-wide background, but almost none cross a conventional significance threshold.

**Gene-level p-value / Z pattern:**
- Most gene p-values satisfy:
  $$p_i > 0.05\quad\text{for most } i.$$
Yet the pathway shows a small but consistent shift in adjusted gene-level Z-scores:

$$
\overline{Z}_{S,\mathrm{adj}} \;=\; \frac{1}{G}\sum_{i\in S} Z_{i,\mathrm{adj}} \;\neq\; 0,
$$

often with a coherent sign (bias in one direction).
- Equivalent distributional statement:
  $$\{p_i: i\in S\}\ \text{is subtly enriched toward smaller values relative to Uniform}(0,1),$$
  but without extreme outliers.
- No sharp elbow, instead, the ranked p-values show a gentle, global downward bend relative to null.

**Interpretation:**  
DPS indicates a **global pathway bias aligned with polygenicity**: numerous genes individually exert minimal impacts in a uniform direction, resulting in pathway enrichment due to the collective subtle shift of the entire module rather than the influence of a singular "star" gene. This is the regime characterized by numerous little issues and the absence of significant challenges. Spike-hunting tests, such as minP/Tippett or highly aggressive truncation, are generally underpowered in this context due to the absence of a singular extreme p-value to leverage. Conversely, mean-/distribution-sensitive tests (Stouffer/mean-Z, Fisher, and competitive regression) are specifically formulated to identify this subtle, pervasive divergence from the null hypothesis.

**Biological example:**  

**Biological example – human height as a diffuse polygenic shift**

The height of adult humans exemplifies a highly polygenic characteristic. Initial GIANT meta-analyses involving over 180,000 individuals identified 180 loci and "hundreds of variants" associated with height. Nevertheless, they accounted for merely 10% of the phenotypic variance, despite height exhibiting approximately 80% heritability. Subsequent meta-analyses involving about 700,000 Europeans identified thousands of linked SNPs and hundreds of locations, validating the perspective that height is regulated by several common variants of minimal effect rather than a limited number of high-impact genes. A recent investigation of a "saturated map" identified over 12,000 genome-wide significant SNPs across more than 7,000 genomic segments, encompassing around 21% of the genome, thereby reaffirming Fisher’s original polygenic hypothesis for height proposed in 1918.

These variants are classified into several growth-related programs, such as chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy in the growth plate, extracellular matrix and cartilage organization, growth hormone and IGF-1 signaling, and morphogen pathways including TGF-β and Hedgehog, as well as overarching developmental and endocrine regulators. Analyses of height GWAS loci through pathway and gene-set evaluations have demonstrated enrichment for signaling pathways such as TGF-β and Hedgehog, as well as for genes associated with skeletal growth, growth plate regulation, and pertinent Mendelian growth disorders. Lango Allen et al. (2010) discovered that genes adjacent to height-associated variants congregate in biologically coherent pathways, including TGF-β signaling, Hedgehog signaling, and histone and growth/development gene sets. Furthermore, several SNPs near these pathway genes "narrowly miss" genome-wide significance, suggesting numerous additional sub-threshold contributors within the same modules. Guo et al. (2018) demonstrate that genes adjacent to height GWAS loci are enriched in processes and tissues pertinent to growth, including growth plate cartilage.

When examined at the level of an individual pathway (e.g., TGF-β signaling, Hedgehog signaling, or growth-plate extracellular matrix genes), this structure inherently produces a **Diffuse Polygenic Shift (DPS)** pattern. Throughout the gene set, numerous genes possess one or more prevalent variations that have minor impacts on height. Certain genes attain definitive genome-wide relevance, while many others exhibit relatively mild or nominal associations. The outcome indicates that, in contrast to random gene sets, the distribution of gene-level test statistics within these pathways exhibits a shift towards more robust evidence overall characterized by an increased number of genes with small or moderate p-values and a decreased number of genes appearing entirely null—despite the fact that most individual genes would not, on their own, substantiate a strong association claim. This scenario exemplifies the optimal application of CATFISH’s DPS-oriented detectors (Stouffer/mean-Z on adjusted gene-level Z-scores, and optionally MAGMA-style competitive regression tests). They assess whether the **average** association signal across a biologically coherent pathway is subtly yet consistently heightened in comparison to the genome-wide background.

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**
- **Stouffer / mean-Z on** `Z_adj` (unweighted; permutation-calibrated) (RECOMMENDED).
- Optionally **competitive regression-style gene-set models** (e.g., **MAGMA competitive**) if included as a component test (NOT INCLUDED IN CATFISH)

## Archetype IV — Hybrid Driver–Support (HDS)

**Signature:** a few very strong genes plus a some moderately associated genes.

**Gene-level p-value pattern:**
- One or a few top genes are extremely significant, e.g.
  $$p_{(1)},\,p_{(2)} \ll 10^{-4}\quad(\text{often much smaller}).$$
- Beyond the top hits, several additional genes show moderate evidence:
  $$p_{(k)} \in [10^{-3},\,0.05]\quad\text{for multiple }k \text{ (support genes).}$$
- The remaining genes are near-null:
  $$p_{(j)} \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)\quad\text{for most other }j.$$
- A small “spike” at the top (drivers) plus a clear “shoulder” of moderately small p-values (support), then a flat tail.

**Interpretation:**  
HDS exhibits a **hierarchical pathway structure**. A small number of “driver” genes exert the most significant effects, whilst a group of genes provides modest yet persistent associations. This is prevalent in pathways where flow or signal is regulated by a limited number of control points, whereas effective route output also relies on the synchronized activity of various downstream components. This architecture is statistically positioned between Sparse Driver (single spike) and Coordinated Moderate Enrichment (wide shoulder). A distinct driver signal exists, although the significance of the pathway is augmented by supplementary moderate signals.

**Biological example** 
**LDL cholesterol as a hybrid driver–support pathway**

The regulation of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) exemplifies a scenario in which a limited number of genes serve as primary "drivers" within a more extensive polygenic framework. Extensive GWAS and sequencing investigations consistently identify *LDLR*, *APOB*, and *PCSK9* as fundamental genes associated with Mendelian hypercholesterolemia. Infrequent coding or splice-altering variants in these genes can alter LDL-C by approximately half a standard deviation or more and are responsible for classical familial hypercholesterolemia, significantly elevating the risk of coronary artery disease. Recent whole-genome sequencing investigations involving over 60,000 individuals reveal that even infrequent *non-coding* variations next to *LDLR* and *PCSK9* can exert effects comparable to clinically recognized exonic FH variants, hence supporting their significance as primary regulators of LDL-C homeostasis.

A supporting network of lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism genes surrounds these drivers. GWAS of traditional lipids and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based lipoprotein characteristics have revealed numerous new loci affecting LDL particle size, concentration, and composition, including apolipoprotein clusters (*APOE/APOC*, *APOA1/A5*), hepatic lipase (*LIPC*), and transporters such as *ABCG5/ABCG8*. Individually, prevalent variants at these loci typically elucidate only a minor proportion of LDL-C variance, however, collectively, they constitute a significant segment of the genome-wide polygenic signal. Recent extensive multi-ancestry meta-analyses now identify hundreds of lipid-associated loci distributed throughout this extensive lipoprotein network.

Translating this biology into gene-level association statistics for an LDL-related trait reveals that the route is neither exclusively "sparse driver" nor entirely "coordinated moderate". Typically, one observes several robust gene-level signals at *LDLR*, *APOB*, *PCSK9*, and a few linked loci, supported by a wider array of modestly correlated genes implicated in lipoprotein assembly, remodeling, and cholesterol transport. The **Hybrid Driver–Support (HDS)** pattern is characterized by a pathway whose enhancement is indicative of both a limited number of predominant, high-impact genes and a legitimate, albeit subtler, influence from the broader metabolic framework. In CATFISH terminology, this refers to the regime when **soft TFisher** (which prioritizes the lower tail while still considering moderate p-values), along with **Fisher** and the **omnibus combination**, aligns effectively with the underlying biology.

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**
- **Soft TFisher** (tail-focused; gains power from a few strong hits *plus* additional modest hits)
- **Fisher** (accumulates evidence across the moderate support set)
- **Omnibus combination** (e.g., ACAT across ACAT/Fisher/soft-TFisher/Stouffer; or permutation-calibrated minP across methods)

---

## Archetype V — Single-Gene Proxy Pathway (SGP)

**Signature:** the pathway looks significant only because it contains one very strong gene; the remaining members look essentially null.

**Gene-level pattern:**
- The top gene has an extremely small p-value (e.g. $10^{-7}\text{--}10^{-12}$).
- The rest of the genes have p-values that look noisy / $\mathrm{Uniform}(0,1)$, with no clear excess of small p’s.
- If you ignore the top gene, there is no obvious enrichment left in the pathway.

**Interpretation:**  
The pathway effectively serves as a proxy for a singular gene-level relationship. This frequently occurs when:
- an annotation term is very small (one gene plus a couple of weakly related neighbors), or
- numerous pathway definitions redundantly incorporate the same driver gene, resulting in several "distinct" pathways activating while all reference the same underlying gene.

Biologically, the driver gene remains significant (and may also align with the SDA), although the pathway-level assertion provides no additional information beyond indicating that "this gene is strongly associated." In CATFISH, we consequently designate SGP patterns as a cautionary note: view these as gene-centric findings with associated pathway designations, rather than as proof that the entire pathway is collectively activated.

**Biological example:**  
**PAH in phenylalanine metabolism**

In humans, phenylalanine metabolism is primarily regulated by a singular bottleneck enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), a hepatic monooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine in a process dependent on tetrahydrobiopterin (BH₄) (Scriver, 2007; Elhawary et al., 2022). Classical phenylketonuria (PKU) and associated forms of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) occur when phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity is significantly diminished, resulting in markedly elevated blood phenylalanine levels, relatively decreased tyrosine levels, and the accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites. This culminates in the distinctive untreated PKU phenotype characterized by extremely high phenylalanine, low tyrosine, and progressive neurological impairment (Elhawary et al., 2022). Extensive clinical and molecular studies indicate that the predominant cause of HPA/PKU cases is pathogenic variants in PAH, whereas a minority results from deficiencies in BH₄ synthesis, recycling, or the PAH co-chaperone DNAJC12 (Blau et al., 2014; Himmelreich et al., 2021; Elhawary et al., 2022). In summary, within the overarching "phenylalanine metabolism" pathway, PAH represents the pivotal flux-controlling step. Both common and rare variations at PAH significantly influence systemic phenylalanine levels, while the majority of other pathway components (transporters, minor side-enzymes, cofactor recycling genes) have considerably weaker or less frequent effects at the population level.

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**
- **minP / Tippett** 
- **ACAT**

## Archetype VI — Competitive Enrichment Above Background (CEAB)  

**Signature:** the pathway is not merely “associated”; it is enriched above the genome-wide polygenic background. It passes a MAGMA competitive test ($\beta_s > 0$), indicating that genes inside the set exhibit, on average, greater associated than those outside the set.

**Gene-level pattern:**

Let $Z_g$ be the gene-level $Z$ used by MAGMA, derived from gene p-values via a probit transform (higher $Z$ = stronger association).  
In a CEAB pathway $s$:

- The distribution of $\{Z_g : g \in s\}$ is elevated in comparison to $\{Z_g : g \notin s\}$. Equivalently, $\mathrm{mean}(Z_{\mathrm{in\_set}}) > \mathrm{mean}(Z_{\mathrm{outside\_set}})$, rather than merely $\mathrm{mean}(Z_{\mathrm{in\_set}}) > 0$.
- The signal is generally not represented by a single-gene proxy; rather, one may see multiple modestly strong genes or a small top-tail alongside an elevated mean. The crucial aspect is that the *average* in-set relationship surpasses the background level
- The pathway retains its significance following MAGMA's default covariate adjustment for confounding gene characteristics (e.g., gene size and gene density, including log-transforms), indicating that it is not "large genes/dense genes" responsible for the observed effect.

**Interpretation:**  
CEAB is the most challenging route narrative to fabricate, as it signifies authentic enrichment rather than: (i) generic polygenicity (where multiple sets appear related under independent testing), (ii) artifacts from annotation overlap, or (iii) confounding effects due to gene size or density.  

Competitive tests possess a more generalized null hypothesis because they explicitly adjust for baseline associations inherent in polygenic characteristics. In MAGMA’s Crohn’s disease case study, numerous gene sets seemed related through self-contained testing; however, only one maintained significance under the competitive hypothesis—demonstrating that CEAB identifies sets with associations that exceed expectations based on polygenicity.

**Biological example**
**From MAGMA’s Crohn’s Disease analysis**  

In the WTCCC Crohn’s disease dataset, MAGMA’s self-contained analysis identified $39$ related gene sets. However the competitive analysis recognized only one of those $39$ as enriched above background: “Regulation of AMPK activity via LKB1 (REACTOME).”

This exemplifies a standard CEAB pattern: the pathway meets the "above-background enrichment" criterion. Two supplementary sets (e.g., *Cell adhesion molecules*; *ECM-receptor interaction*) attained competitive significance solely when gene size/density correction was disabled, which MAGMA reads as (at least partially) confounding-induced inflating rather than genuine enrichment.

**Best detectors in CATFISH:**

- MAGMA competitive p-value (from `*.gsa.out`) as an external “above-background” anchor:  
  if $p_{\mathrm{comp}}$ is small and $\beta_s > 0$, interpret as CEAB-supported enrichment.

### Bias warning
Pathway-based analysis for assessing over-representation or enrichment is influenced by various biases, including gene size, pathway size, SNP coverage density, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, all of which must be addressed explicitly (White et al., 2020; PMC6391732). In CATFISH, we tackle these issues in three phases: (i) The SNP to gene analysis is conducted using MAGMA’s LD-aware multi-SNP model, ensuring that gene-level Z/P values account for local LD structure and SNP density; (ii) we subsequently regress MAGMA gene Z-scores against log(gene length) and log(number of SNPs), utilizing the residual-based $P_adj$ for all subsequent gene to pathway analyses, thereby eliminating any remaining dependence on gene size and SNP density; and (iii) at the pathway level, we eschew simplistic over-representation tests, opting instead to calibrate our omnibus statistics through gene-label LD-aware permutations that maintain each gene’s adjusted p-value and the observed distribution of pathway sizes, yielding enrichment p-values that are resilient to these established biases.

## METHODS

### Notation
## Gene-level covariate adjustment (gene length & SNP density)

Let a pathway (gene set) be denoted by $S$, containing $G = |S|$ genes indexed by $g = 1,\dots,G$.

For each gene $g \in S$, let:
- $Z_g$ denote the raw gene-level $Z$-statistic, and
- $p_g$ denote the corresponding two-sided $p$-value.

We collect these into vectors:

$$
\mathbf{Z}_S = (Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_G),
\qquad
\mathbf{p}_S = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_G).
$$

To remove residual dependence on gene length and SNP density, we fit a linear model:

$$
Z_g = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(L_g) + \beta_2 \log(\mathrm{SNPs}_g) + \varepsilon_g.
$$

We define the adjusted $Z$-scores as the regression residuals:

$$
Z_{g,\mathrm{adj}} = \hat{\varepsilon}_g.
$$

The corresponding adjusted two-sided $p$-values are:

$$
p_{g,\mathrm{adj}} = 2\,\Phi\!\left(-\left|Z_{g,\mathrm{adj}}\right|\right),
$$

where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF.

We denote the adjusted vectors by:

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{S,\mathrm{adj}} = (Z_{1,\mathrm{adj}}, \dots, Z_{G,\mathrm{adj}}),
\qquad
\mathbf{p}_{S,\mathrm{adj}} = (p_{1,\mathrm{adj}}, \dots, p_{G,\mathrm{adj}}).
$$

## 1) Gene-level association statistics (SNP → gene)

For each gene $g$, MAGMA produces a gene‑level association p‑value $p_g$ by aggregating SNP‑level signals within/near the gene while accounting for local LD using a reference panel. We used MAGMA’s `multi=snp-wise` model, which combines a SNP-wise mean test (good for many small effects) and a SNP-wise top test (good for a single strong SNP) into a single LD-aware omnibus statistic per gene, making the gene p-values robust to different within-gene causal architectures.

The workflow includes:

- SNPs are mapped to genes (gene boundaries with optional windows).
- A multi‑marker gene model accounts for LD among SNPs in the gene region.
- MAGMA outputs gene statistics (e.g., $Z_g$ and $p_g$).

In CATFISH, these MAGMA gene p-values (or Z statistics) are treated as the inputs to all pathway tests.

---

## 2) Gene-level adjustment for gene size and SNP density

Even with LD-aware gene testing, gene‑level signals can exhibit residual dependence on gene size and SNP density. CATFISH performs a post‑hoc adjustment at the gene level.

Let:

- $Z_g$ be the MAGMA gene Z‑statistic,
- $L_g$ be gene length (bp),
- $S_g$ be number of SNPs mapped to the gene (e.g., $$NSNPS$$).

We fit a regression line as:

$$
Z_g = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(L_g) + \beta_2 \log(S_g) + \varepsilon_g.
$$

We define adjusted residual Z as:

$$
Z^{\mathrm{adj}}_g = Z_g - \widehat{Z}_g,
\quad \widehat{Z}_g = \widehat{\beta}_0 + \widehat{\beta}_1 \log(L_g) + \widehat{\beta}_2 \log(S_g).
$$

We then convert to a two‑sided adjusted p-value:

$$
p^{\mathrm{adj}}_g = 2\Phi\left(-|Z^{\mathrm{adj}}_g|\right),
$$

where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF.

---

## 3) Pathway-level test statistics (gene → pathway)

CATFISH computes multiple pathway statistics from $\{p_g\}_{g \in S}$ $\{Z_g\}_{Z \in S}$.

### 3.1 ACAT (Aggregated Cauchy Association Test)

Define the Cauchy‑transformed score for each gene:

$$
t_g = \tan\left(\pi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} - p_g\right)\right).
$$

Define non‑negative weights $w_g \ge 0$ with $\sum_{g \in S} w_g = 1$ (default $w_g = 1/G$).

The ACAT statistic is:

$$
T_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S) = \sum_{g \in S} w_g\, t_g
= \sum_{g \in S} w_g \tan\left(\pi\left(\tfrac{1}{2} - p_g\right)\right).
$$

The combined p-value is:

$$
p_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S) = \tfrac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi}\arctan\left(T_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S)\right).
$$

**Key property (interpretation):** ACAT is asymptotically dominated by the smallest p-values, and is therefore sensitive to **sparse driver** architectures.

---

### 3.2 Fisher’s method

Fisher’s statistic is:

$$
T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S) = -2\sum_{g \in S} \log(p_g).
$$

Under independence,

$$
T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S) \sim \chi^2_{2G},
\quad
p_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S) = 1 - F_{\chi^2_{2G}}\left(T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S)\right),
$$

where $F_{\chi^2_{2G}}(\cdot)$ is the $\chi^2$ CDF with $2G$ degrees of freedom.

**Key property (interpretation):** Fisher is sensitive to **coordinated moderate enrichment** (many moderately small p-values).

---

### 3.3 Soft TFisher (tail-focused truncation and weighting)

To focus power on the lower tail of gene-level p-values while avoiding a hard cutoff, we use the **soft-thresholded TFisher** statistic of Zhang et al. (2020).

Fix a truncation / weighting parameter $\tau \in (0,1]$. For a pathway $S$ with adjusted gene-level p-values $\{p_g\}_{g \in S}$, the soft TFisher statistic is:

$$
T_{\mathrm{TF}}^{\mathrm{soft}}(S;\tau) = \sum_{g \in S} \left[ -2\log(p_g) + 2\log(\tau) \right]_{+}.
$$

Here $(x)_{+} = \max(x,0)$.

Equivalently, only genes with $p_g \le \tau$ contribute to the statistic, but their contribution is smoothly down-weighted as $p_g$ approaches $\tau$: very small $p_g$ behave like Fisher's $-2\log(p_g)$, $p_g$ near $\tau$ contribute little, and $p_g > \tau$ contribute exactly zero.

This corresponds to the $\tau_1 = \tau_2 = \tau$ special case of the general TFisher family (Zhang et al., 2020, Eq. 2.1–2.2).

Soft TFisher interpolates between:

- **Fisher's method** when $\tau = 1$, and  
- **hard truncated tests** (e.g. TPM / RTP) when $\tau < 1$, but with continuous, stable weighting instead of a sharp cutoff.

In CATFISH, we apply:

$$
T_{\mathrm{TF}}^{\mathrm{soft}}(S;\tau)
$$

to adjusted gene-level p-values $p_{g,\mathrm{adj}}$, using the analytic null distribution for TFisher with $\tau_1 = \tau_2 = \tau$ (Zhang et al., 2020, Theorem 1).

**Key property (interpretation):** Soft TFisher is especially sensitive to **Hybrid Driver–Support (HDS)** and **Coordinated Moderate Enrichment (CME)** architectures.


---

### 3.4 Stouffer's method (mean-Z; diffuse polygenic shift)

Stouffer aggregates gene-level **Z** statistics (e.g., $$Z_{g,\mathrm{adj}}$$) rather than p-values.  
For a pathway $$S$$ with $$G=|S|$$ genes, define:

**Unweighted Stouffer:**

$$
Z_{\mathrm{stouffer}}(S) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{G}} \sum_{g \in S} Z_g
$$

$$
p_{\mathrm{stouffer}}(S) = 2\,\Phi\!\left(-\left|Z_{\mathrm{stouffer}}(S)\right|\right)
$$

where $$\Phi(\cdot)$$ is the standard normal CDF.

**Weighted Stouffer (optional):** choose weights $$w_g \geq 0$$.

$$
Z_{\mathrm{stouffer}}^{(w)}(S) = \frac{\sum_{g \in S} w_g Z_g}{\sqrt{\sum_{g \in S} w_g^2}}
$$

$$
p_{\mathrm{stouffer}}^{(w)}(S) = 2\,\Phi\!\left(-\left|Z_{\mathrm{stouffer}}^{(w)}(S)\right|\right)
$$

**Notes:**
- Best for **Diffuse Polygenic Shift (DPS)**: many small positive (or negative) shifts in $$Z_g$$ that may not yield many $$p_g<0.05$$ individually.
- If calibrating by permutation, recompute $$Z_{\mathrm{stouffer}}$$ (or $$Z_{\mathrm{stouffer}}^{(w)}$$) under permuted gene labels and use an empirical p-value.

---
### 3.5 minP / Tippett (single-gene proxy diagnostic)

Define the pathway's minimum gene p-value:

$$
p_{\min} = \min_{g \in S} p_g
$$

Under independence, Tippett's combined p-value is:

$$
p_{\mathrm{tippett}} = 1 - (1 - p_{\min})^G
$$

But because gene p-values are correlated (LD, shared biology), CATFISH typically treats **minP as a diagnostic** and/or calibrates it by permutation:

Let:
- $$p_{\min}^{\mathrm{obs}}$$ be the observed minimum p-value
- $$p_{\min}^{(b)}$$ be the minimum p-value in permutation $$b$$
- $$B$$ be the total number of permutations

Then the permutation p-value is:

$$
p_{\min}^{\mathrm{perm}} = \frac{1 + \text{count}(p_{\min}^{(b)} \leq p_{\min}^{\mathrm{obs}})}{B + 1}
$$

where $$\text{count}(\cdot)$$ counts the number of permutations satisfying the condition.

**Notes:**
- Highly sensitive to **single extreme genes**, so it flags **Sparse Driver (SDA)** and especially **Single-Gene Proxy (SGP)** pathways.
- Use "remove top gene and recompute" as the practical SGP check.
---

## 4) Correlation among pathway tests

All pathway statistics above are functions of the same gene-level p-values $$\{p_g\}$$ and are therefore intrinsically correlated. For a given pathway $$S$$, define $$T_{\mathrm{ACAT}},\$$ $$T_{\mathrm{Fisher}},\$$ $$T_{\mathrm{TF}}^{\mathrm{soft}}(\tau),\$$ $$T_{\mathrm{Stouffer}},\$$ $$T_{\mathrm{minP}},\$$
where

- $$T_{\mathrm{ACAT}}$$ is the ACAT statistic on $$S$$ (Section 3.1),
- $$T_{\mathrm{Fisher}}$$ is the Fisher / sum–log–p statistic (Section 3.2),
- $$T_{\mathrm{TF}}^{\mathrm{soft}}(\tau)$$ is the soft–TFisher statistic with truncation parameter $$\tau$$ (Section 3.3),
- $$T_{\mathrm{Stouffer}}$$ is the (possibly weighted) Stouffer / mean-$$Z$$ statistic, and
- $$T_{\min} = \min_{g \in S} p_g$$ is the Tippett / minP statistic.

Under the null, this vector is **not** jointly independent, because each component is a deterministic function of the same set of p-values $$\{p_g\}$$ (or equivalently the same ordered p-values $$\{p_{(k)}\}$$).

Intuitively:

- **Fisher** and **soft TFisher** are both based on $$-\log(p_g)$$, with TFisher acting like a truncated / reweighted Fisher focused on $$p_g \le \tau$$. Whenever the sum of $$-\log(p_g)$$ is large (many small p-values), both statistics tend to be extreme in the same direction.

- **Stouffer** first maps p-values to $$Z$$-scores via $$Z_g = \Phi^{-1}(1 - p_g/2)$$ and then averages or sums them. This is a monotone transform of the same $$\{p_g\}$$, so pathways with many small p-values will simultaneously inflate Fisher, TFisher, and Stouffer.

- **ACAT** and **soft TFisher** both emphasize the **lower tail**: ACAT uses $$\tan\{\pi(0.5 - p_g)\}$$ (very heavy weight on the smallest p’s), while TFisher heavily weights small $$p_g$$ through $$-\log(p_g)$$ below $$\tau$$. A pathway with one or a few very small p-values will push both $$T_{\mathrm{ACAT}}$$ and $$T_{\mathrm{TF}}^{\mathrm{soft}}(\tau)$$ in the same direction.

- **minP** is literally the smallest p-value $$p_{(1)}$$. It is almost perfectly aligned with the extreme-tail behavior of ACAT and the most aggressive truncation versions of TFisher: whenever $$p_{(1)}$$ is tiny, ACAT, TFisher, and often Fisher / Stouffer will also look unusually extreme.

On top of this, linkage disequilibrium and shared biology induce correlation among the gene-level inputs themselves (the $$\{p_g\}$$ and corresponding $$\{Z_g\}$$ are not independent across genes), which further strengthens dependence among all of the pathway-level statistics.

**Implication.** Because $$T_{\mathrm{ACAT}},\$$ $$T_{\mathrm{Fisher}},\$$ $$T_{\mathrm{TF}}^{\mathrm{soft}}(\tau),\$$ $$T_{\mathrm{Stouffer}},\$$ $$T_{\mathrm{minP}},\$$
is strongly dependent, naïve combination rules that assume independence between component tests (e.g. simple Bonferroni or analytic minP under independence) would generally be mis-calibrated and often anti-conservative. This is why CATFISH uses **permutation-calibrated minP across methods** (and treats ACAT-O as a model-based sensitivity analysis), so that the joint null distribution of these correlated statistics is learned empirically rather than assumed.


---

## 5) Omnibus pathway p-value across methods

Each pathway in CATFISH is evaluated by a panel of complementary gene → pathway tests (ACAT, Fisher, soft TFisher, Stouffer, and minP), each tuned to a different pattern of gene-level signal. Because these five statistics are all functions of the same adjusted gene p-values, they are strongly correlated and can disagree in which pathways they call “most” enriched. Rather than choosing a single favorite test a priori, we combine their evidence into a **single omnibus pathway p-value** using two complementary strategies: (i) an analytic ACAT-O combination across method-level p-values, and (ii) a permutation-calibrated minP across methods that provides a dependence-robust, “best-of-tests” summary. The following subsections describe these two omnibus layers.


### 5.1 Omnibus ACAT (ACAT-O across methods)

Let $$p_1, \dots, p_5$$ denote the five component p-values for pathway $$S$$, and let weights $$v_j \ge 0$$ satisfy $$\sum_{j=1}^5 v_j = 1$$ (default $$v_j = 1/5$$).

Define the ACAT-O Cauchy statistic

$$T_{\mathrm{omni,ACAT}}(S) = \sum_{j=1}^5 v_j \,\tan\{\pi(0.5 - p_j)\},$$
which under the global null is approximately standard Cauchy. The analytic omnibus p-value is
$$p_{\mathrm{omni,ACAT}}(S)= 0.5 - \frac{1}{\pi}\arctan\{T_{\mathrm{omni,ACAT}}(S)\}.$$

This ACAT-O layer is most sensitive when **at least one** component test (e.g. ACAT for sparse drivers, Fisher/Stouffer for coordinated enrichment, soft TFisher for hybrid patterns, or minP for hard single-gene hits) is strongly significant, even if the others are only modest or null.

---

### 5.2 Omnibus minP across methods with permutation 

To obtain a complementary, more conservative summary that explicitly accounts for correlation between component tests, we also compute a minimum-p omnibus statistic across methods: 

$$T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S) = \min_{j \in \{1,\dots,5\}} p_j= \min\({ p_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S), p_{\mathrm{Fisher}}(S),p_{\mathrm{TF}}(S;\tau), p_{\mathrm{Stouffer}}(S),p_{\mathrm{minP}}(S) \})$$ 

Because the $$p_j$$ are correlated (they are all computed from the same set of gene-level p-values), we calibrate $$T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)$$ by gene-label permutation. 

For each of $$B$$ permutations: 

- randomize gene labels across pathways (preserving the empirical distribution of gene-level p-values and pathway sizes),
- recompute all five component tests for each pathway,
- record, for permutation $$b = 1,\dots,B$$, $$T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}^{(b)}(S) = \min_j p_j^{(b)}(S)$$

The permutation-based omnibus p-value is then 

$$\hat p_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)= \frac{1 + \text{count}\{\,b : T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}^{(b)}(S)\le T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)\,\}}{B + 1}$$ 

We use $$\hat p_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)$$ as the **primary** omnibus p-value in the main analyses because it 

1. protects nominal type-I error under *arbitrary* dependence between component tests, and
2. explicitly targets the "best" component test for each pathway while accounting for the fact that this best test is effectively chosen post hoc via the min across methods.

The analytic ACAT-O p-value $$p_{\mathrm{omni,ACAT}}(S)$$ is reported alongside as a **higher-power, model-based sensitivity analysis**, highlighting pathways that are consistently strong across methods or dominated by a single very informative test.

---

## 6) Multiple testing correction

Across all pathways, omnibus p-values $\{p_{\mathrm{omni}}(S)\}$ are adjusted using Benjamini–Hochberg FDR:

$$
q_{\mathrm{BH}}(S) = \mathrm{BH}\left(p_{\mathrm{omni}}(S)\right).
$$

Because each pathway yields a **single** omnibus p-value, no additional penalty is required for the number of component tests.

---

## 7) Omnibus across methods with permutation (LD-aware upstream gene statistics)

To obtain a complementary, conservative omnibus summary that explicitly accounts for dependence among component pathway tests, we compute a minimum-p statistic across the five component pathway $$S$$ p-values, and calibrate it using either pathway-specific or global gene-label resampling.
Let

$$\mathcal{P}(S)=\{p_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S)\,p_{\mathrm{wFisher}}(S)\,p_{\mathrm{TPM}}(S;\tau)\,p_{\mathrm{Stouffer}}(S)\,p_{\mathrm{minP,gene}}(S)\}$$

The omnibus minimum statistic is

$$T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)=\min \mathcal{P}(S)=\min\!\{p_{\mathrm{ACAT}}(S),\,p_{\mathrm{wFisher}}(S),\,p_{\mathrm{TPM}}(S;\tau),\,p_{\mathrm{Stouffer}}(S),\,p_{\mathrm{minP,gene}}(S)\}.$$

Because all $$p_j(S)$$ are computed from the *same* gene-level association evidence and therefore are correlated, $$T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)$$ is not Uniform $$(0,1)$$ under the null. We therefore calibrate the minP omnibus by permutation.

#### 7.1 LD-aware gene-level inputs via MAGMA

All pathway tests operate on gene-level summary statistics computed using MAGMA's SNP-to-gene model with an LD reference panel. Specifically, GWAS summary statistics are mapped to genes (with a symmetric $$\pm 25$$ kb window), and MAGMA is run using the multi-model SNP-wise gene analysis. This step is LD-aware: within each gene, SNP associations are aggregated while accounting for linkage disequilibrium in the reference genotypes, producing gene-level test statistics (e.g., $$Z_g$$, $$P_g$$) that are appropriately calibrated under correlated SNP structure.

To reduce confounding by gene size and SNP density, we additionally adjust gene-level $$Z_g$$ (or $$-\log_{10} P_g$$) by regressing on log(gene length) and log(#SNPs) and using residual-based, size-adjusted gene p-values $$P_g^{\mathrm{adj}}$$. These adjusted gene p-values are the inputs to all pathway-level component tests.

This design ensures that LD is handled where it matters most and is most identifiable from data—at the SNP-to-gene aggregation stage—while keeping downstream pathway aggregation flexible across multiple alternative signal architectures.

#### 7.2 Component pathway tests

For each pathway $$S$$ with member genes $$g \in S$$, we compute five complementary pathway p-values from the (optionally adjusted) gene-level p-values $$\{P_g\}_{g\in S}$$:

1. **ACAT**: sensitive to sparse signals and a few very strong genes.
2. **Weighted Fisher (wFisher)**: aggregates evidence across genes with optional weights (e.g., SNP counts) and can incorporate effect direction when available.
3. **Truncated Product Method / truncated Fisher (TPM)** with truncation $$\tau$$: emphasizes moderate subsets of more significant genes while down-weighting null genes.
4. **Stouffer**: combines gene-level Z-scores (or Z reconstructed from p-values under the null) to target diffuse polygenic enrichment.
5. **Gene-level minP**: a diagnostic "single-gene proxy" detector, capturing whether the pathway is driven by one extreme gene.

These tests are deliberately correlated but have different power profiles across latent pathway architectures. The minP omnibus selects the best-performing component while controlling for this post hoc selection.

#### 7.3 Gene-label permutation calibration of the minP omnibus

We calibrate $$T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)$$ using gene-label permutation implemented either on a per-pathway basis or via a global resampling scheme, which preserves (i) the empirical distribution of gene-level p-values and (ii) the observed pathway sizes, while breaking pathway membership.

For each permutation $$b = 1,\dots,B$$ and each pathway $$S$$ with $$|S|$$ genes:

1. **Sample a null gene set** $$S^{(b)}$$ by selecting $$|S|$$ genes uniformly without replacement from the pool of all genes with non-missing gene-level p-values.
2. **Recompute all component tests** on the sampled gene set, yielding

   $$p_j^{(b)}(S), \quad j \in \{\mathrm{ACAT},\mathrm{wFisher},\mathrm{TPM},\mathrm{Stouffer},\mathrm{minP,gene}\}$$

3. Record the permutation min statistic

   $$T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}^{(b)}(S) = \min_j p_j^{(b)}(S)$$

The permutation-calibrated omnibus p-value is then

$$\hat p_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)=\frac{1 + \bigl|\{\,b : T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}^{(b)}(S)\le T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)\,\}\bigr|}{B + 1}$$

In practice, this procedure is implemented in MAGCAT/CATFISH as follows:

- we construct the gene pool from MAGMA gene results (after optional size/SNP adjustment),
- for each pathway we generate $$B$$ random gene sets of identical size,
- for each permuted gene set we recompute the five component pathway tests using the same parameters (e.g., truncation $$\tau$$ for TPM),
- we compute $$\hat p_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)$$ using the standard "+1" correction to avoid zero p-values.

This permutation directly addresses correlation between the component tests because the full multivariate dependence induced by shared inputs and shared pathways is mirrored under permutation.

#### 7.4 Rationale and interpretation

We use $$\hat p_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)$$ as the **primary** omnibus p-value in the main analyses because it:

1. controls type-I error under *arbitrary dependence* among component tests (all derived from the same gene-level signals),
2. properly accounts for "winner's curse" induced by taking a minimum across multiple methods,
3. remains robust across diverse pathway signal architectures by adaptively selecting the most informative component per pathway.

The analytic ACAT-O omnibus $$p_{\mathrm{omni,ACAT}}(S)$$ is reported alongside as a **higher-power, model-based sensitivity analysis**, highlighting pathways with consistent support across methods or those dominated by a single exceptionally sensitive component.

#### 7.5 Note on LD-awareness and the permutation layer

A key design choice is that LD-awareness is enforced upstream at the SNP-to-gene stage via MAGMA's LD-informed gene model. The omnibus permutation described above is a gene-label permutation and therefore does not explicitly resimulate LD structure. Instead, it leverages the fact that the gene-level p-values already represent LD-adjusted gene evidence; the permutation step is used to calibrate dependence *between pathway-level test statistics* and to control for post hoc selection across multiple correlated pathway tests.

This tiered strategy allows computationally feasible, robust omnibus inference using only GWAS summary statistics and an LD reference panel, while retaining sensitivity to multiple plausible pathway architectures.

### 7.6 Global gene-label resampling (`resample_global`)

In addition to pathway-specific gene-label permutation, CATFISH optionally supports a **global resampling strategy** (`resample_global`) for calibrating the minP omnibus statistic.

Under `resample_global`, a **single set of B gene-label permutations** is generated once and reused across *all* pathways. For each permutation `b = 1,…,B`, gene labels (or equivalently the vector of gene-level p-values) are permuted across the full gene pool. For each pathway `S`, the subset of permuted gene-level statistics corresponding to the genes in $$S$$ is extracted and all component pathway tests are recomputed.

For permutation `b` and pathway `S`, we compute

$$p_j^{(b)}(S),\quad j \in \{\mathrm{ACAT},\mathrm{Fisher},\mathrm{TPM},\mathrm{Stouffer},\mathrm{minP,gene}\},$$

and record the global permutation min statistic

$$T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}^{(b)}(S)=\min_j p_j^{(b)}(S)$$

The permutation-calibrated omnibus p-value is then

$$\hat p_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)=\frac{1 + \left|\{\,b : T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}^{(b)}(S)\le T_{\mathrm{omni,min}}(S)\,\}\right|}{B + 1}$$

Unlike pathway-specific resampling, the same permuted gene-level realizations are shared across all pathways, rather than generating an independent null gene set for each pathway.

#### 7.6.1 Rationale for global resampling

The `resample_global` strategy has three practical advantages:

1. **Computational efficiency**  
   A single set of `B` permutations is reused across all pathways, substantially reducing runtime and memory usage.

2. **Consistent null across pathways**  
   All pathways are calibrated against the same empirical null distribution, improving comparability of omnibus p-values across pathways of different sizes.

3. **Preservation of cross-pathway dependence**  
   Because the same permuted gene-level realizations are used for all pathways, dependence induced by overlapping gene sets or shared pathway membership is naturally preserved under the null.

#### 7.6.2 Relationship to LD-awareness

As with pathway-specific permutation, `resample_global` operates on **LD-adjusted gene-level statistics** produced by MAGMA. The resampling step does not explicitly re-simulate SNP-level LD; instead, LD is handled upstream at the SNP-to-gene aggregation stage. Global resampling is used to calibrate dependence *between pathway-level test statistics* and to control for post hoc selection across multiple correlated pathway tests.

#### 7.6.3 Practical guidance

In CATFISH, pathway-specific permutation and `resample_global` typically yield similar results when pathway sizes are moderate and gene overlap is limited. We recommend:

- **pathway-specific resampling** for small analyses or targeted pathway sets, and  
- **`resample_global`** for large pathway collections, genome-wide scans, or when computational efficiency and cross-pathway consistency are priorities.

Both approaches provide valid calibration of the minP omnibus under arbitrary dependence among component tests.

## - MAGMA gene p-values are known to correlate weakly with gene size and SNP density.
## - magcat_adjust_gene_p():
##   * Fits a linear model: Z_raw ~ log(gene length) + log(#SNPs).
##   * Uses residuals (Z_adj) as “size/SNP-adjusted” Z-scores.
##   * Converts Z_adj back to P_adj = 2*pnorm(-|Z_adj|).
## - You then use P_adj in gene→pathway tests, reducing bias toward big genes.

## 7. Omnibus combining methods (ACAT or minP)
############################################################

## All tests use gene_results + species/pathways to:
##  - find genes per pathway,
##  - take their p-values (raw P or adjusted P_adj),
##  - compute a pathway-level p per method.

omni_minp <- omni_pathways(
  gene_results      = genes_adj,
  species           = "maize",
  gene_col          = "GENE",

  remove_singletons = TRUE,
  output            = TRUE,
  out_dir           = "magcat_omni_full"
)

## In a single call omni_pathways gives you:
##   - acat_p       : ACAT pvalue per pathway
##   - fisher_p    : Fisher pvalue per pathway
##   - tpm_p        : truncated Fisher (soft) pvalue per pathway
##   - stouffer_p   : Stouffer pvalue per pathway
##   - minp_gene_p  : minP pvalue per pathway
##   - omni_p       : combination of these methods (ACAT or minP) pvalue per pathway
##   - omni_perm_p  : permutation-calibrated omnibus pvalues
##   - BH FDR for omni_p and each component
##   - omni_perm_BH  : permutation-calibrated BH pvalues using perm pvalues

  output       = TRUE,
  out_dir      = "magcat_stouffer"
