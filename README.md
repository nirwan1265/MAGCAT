# MAGCAT
MAGCAT: R interface to MAGMA with ACAT-based gene and pathway aggregation.

MAGCAT is an R interface to the MAGMA (Multi-marker Analysis of Genomic Annotation) software with ACAT (Aggregated Cauchy Association Test) for pathway level analysis. It streamlines SNP-to-gene analysis using MAGMA, imports gene-level results into R, and provides flexible ACAT-based gene-set and pathway aggregation, making it easy to build reproducible post-GWAS enrichment pipelines.
